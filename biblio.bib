abstract = {The topic of youth civic engagement is increasingly popular in social science research; however, the question of why some youth are civically involved while others are not is not well understood. This article addresses the following questions: What motivations and barriers do youth report for civic involvement? How do motivations and barriers differ across school contexts? A qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviews with youth (N = 22) was used to identify four categories of motivations and two categories of barriers for civic involvement. Variation emerged in the motivations and barriers for civic involvement both within and across school contexts. Understanding civic motivations in context uncovers new insights about how to structure opportunities to better facilitate youth civic involvement.},

P2: What motivations and barriers do youth report for civic involvement? How do motivations and barriers differ across school contexts? 
P3, MY THOUGHTS: {\&}quot; The success of democratic societies depends on whether, and how, citizens engage with others in social organizations, take collective action, and work toward goals that will benefit society (e.g., Flanagan {\&}amp; Faison, 2001; Verba, Schlozman, {\&}amp; Brady, 1995). {\&}quot;:

Democratic societies rely on citizen engagement; the way in which denizens act collectively, how they collaborate to achieve goals, and how they engage with social organisations, determines the progress of democratic societies (Flanagan {\&}amp; Faison 2001; Verba, Schlozman {\&}amp; Brady 1995 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p2).
Beneficial outcomes have been clearly identified as a result of citizen engagement and social discourse around civic issues (Ballard 2014, p2)
Individual benefits arising from engagement include empowerment and personal development (Youniss, McLellan {\&}amp; Yates 1997 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p2), as well as ;representation of personal issues in the political realm (Flanagan 2009 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p2),
Environmental contexts also feature prominently in the literature. Researchers have looked at the influence of family (Pancer, Pratt, Hunsberger {\&}amp; Alisat 2007; Wray-Lake 2008 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3), peer groups (Pancer et al. 2007; Youniss, McLellan {\&}amp; Mazer 2001 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3) to school and neighbourhood composition (Levinson 2010; Torney-Purta 2002; Atkins {\&}amp; Hart 2003; Hart {\&}amp; Kirshner 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3)
It has been suggested that lack of opportunities is a key aspect of non-engagement in adolescence (Ballard 2014, p3).
Opportunities available in schools and neighbourhoods is understood as a key predictor of engagement (Youniss {\&}amp; Levine 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3).
Providing opportunities and offering invitations for civic engagement is the focus of many developmental approaches of research (eg Flanagan 2009; Youniss {\&}amp; Levine 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3).
Much of the research on civic involvement have looked at demographic predictors of engagement, yet this research is not comprehensive enough to explain involvement, nor does it accurately predict involvement (Ballard 2014, p3). Researchers are able to identify characteristics from gender, age, race, citizenship status and socioeconomic status (Cemalcilar 2009; Foster-Bey 2008; Levinson 2007 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3) to qualities and attitudes such as empathy (Penner 2003 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3), civic obligation (Matsuba, Hart {\&}amp; Atkins 2007 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3) to political and civic awareness (Delli Carpini {\&}amp; Keeter 1996; Galston 2001 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p3).
Providing opportunities to youth in low socioeconomic areas has been identified as a means to increase engagement (Wilkenfeld 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p4)
Disengaged youth identified by socio-economic, ethnic, education and racial differences are understood as falling into the {\&}quot;civic achievement gap{\&}quot; (Kahne {\&}amp; Middaugh 2008; Levinson 2001, 2010; Youniss {\&}amp; Levine 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p4).
Youth engagement literature has strong undertones about the importance of meaningful engagement opportunities (Ballard 2014, p4).
Increasing opportunities is inherent in increasing both individual and social benefits of youth engagement (Ballard 2014, p4).
MOTIVATION: The position taken by many academics to increase engagement opportunities and invitations (eg Youniss {\&}amp; Levine 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p4), suggests a false dichotomy of influence between society and the individual.
Whilst significant research exists around predictors of engagement, there is still little known about why individual youth in similar situation get involved, while others do not, or whether certain motivators are more influential to particular demographics (Ballard 2014, p4)
Kurt Lewin's theory of social action explores the influences of internal and external processes on civic behaviours (Snyder 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p4); Lewin suggests that individual values, combined with experiences, influences goal oriented actions (Batson, Ahmad {\&}amp; Tsang 2002 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p4-5).
More recent research has also affirmed the relationship between values and experiences as indicators of social engagement (Penner 2003; Rubin 2007 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p5).
Understanding both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations also contributes to understanding civic engagement (Deci {\&}amp; Ryan 1985 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p5). There has also been a suggested link between initial extrinsic motivators, such as building experience for resume or college applications (eg Flanagan 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p5), and ongoing intrinsic motivators for engagement (Henderson, Brown, Pancer {\&}amp; Ellis-Hale 2007; Metz {\&}amp; Youniss 2005 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p5). Criticism has arisen, though, around required service or emphasis on external motivations (eg Warburton {\&}amp; Smith 2003 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p5).
FUTURE RESEARCH - how initial motivations differ from ongoing motivations; how sustained involvement is influenced by motivations and subsequent civic experiences (Ballard 2014, p21)
Research on derived meaning of civic engagement makes conclusions around meaning as a source of motivation. Four motivations are proposed by Verba et al. (1995 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p5) in their work on political and civic behaviours in adults: material, social and civic gratifications, and wanting to affect policy change. Additionally, Sherrod, Flanagan {\&}amp; Youniss (2002 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p5) suggest individual satisfaction, societal efficacy and the promotion of communal values are viewed as both outcomes and motivations synonymously.
Insignificant research exists with the explicit focus of civic motivations, yet research in other fields provides insights.
Fredricks et al. (2002 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6) looked at changing motivations alongside extracurricular activities; Pearce {\&}amp; Larson (2006 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6) looked into similar field with a focus on youth activities, concluding that such engagement is motivated by the desire to meet social or personal needs.
Such literature identifies extrinsic motivations as the primary initial reason for engagement, while ongoing motivations often differed - this 'transformation of goals' is identified by Colby {\&}amp; Damon (1992 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6).
Adult motivations was also addressed in public service research. This research suggests individuals have a predisposition to public service, and that particular indicators such as religion, gender, education and family environment are antecedents for such work (Perry, Brundey, Coursey {\&}amp; Littlepage 2008; Perry {\&}amp; Wise 1990 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6).
Motivations around adult volunteering behaviours looked at individual traits and experiences influence initial and ongoing civic identity and involvement (Penner 2003 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6).
Intrinsic motivations were recognised through the research of Omoto {\&}amp; Snyder (1995 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6), which focused on recruitment and ongoing engagement of adult volunteers. This research identified three predictors of volunteering: life circumstance, individual qualities, as well as personal needs and motivations. The overwhelming focus on adult engagement in the motivation literature ;is evident (eg Penner 2003; Perry {\&}amp; Wise 1990 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6). Civic motivations (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006; Penner 2003; Perry 1990 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6) and changes in motivation (Fredricks et al. 2002 ;FYISEE Ballard 2014, p6) informs understanding on youth motivation, yet may overlook distinctions between initial and ongoing, as well as discrepancies between immediate and remembered motivations of initial engagement.; MY THOUGHTS: Since much of the research into adult motivations acknowledges the importance of civic engagement during adolescence, understanding youth motivations seems an obvious gap.
Understanding civic development requires knowledge of local institutions and social contexts (Jahromi 2011; Rubin 2007 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p7)
Research into the development of civic identities in adolescence acknowledges the importance of the frequent negative interactions with authority figures - police, social workers and teachers.
Research which includes both engaged and disengaged youth serve to overcome lack of knowledge about the {\&}quot;civic empowerment gap{\&}quot; (eg Ballard 2014, p8).
To analyse interview questions, both open coding (as described in Strauss {\&}amp; Corbin 1990 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p9) and theory-based content analysis (as discussed by Weber FYISEE Ballard 2014, p9) can guide understanding on both the nature of motivation as well as emerging themes.
Categories of motivations that emerged from Ballard's (2014, p10) work are: causes and issues where youth indicated they were passionate; beliefs and attitudes about the importance of civic engagement; personal goals derived from ideas of self-improvement; and individual or group invitational responses.
Issues or causes often personally affected the individual, was often locally based and one with which they personally identified. Believing that civic engagement, itself, was important, was identified as a more general motivator, one which did not link with a particular issue not rely on an individual's connection to the action (Ballard 2014, p12).
Motivations that revolved around individual goals often identified individual advancement in either skills, knowledge or experience; this motivation links to the extrinsic rewards identified by Flanagan (2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p13). Whilst youth acknowledge the importance of civic engagement for personal development, this motivation was seldom cited in isolation from outward oriented motivations of personal beliefs or causes.
Ballard(2014, p14) identified a correlation between students from higher resourced schools and individual development as the primary motivator. Four of the youth identified their primary motivation was that of self-goals; these youth were also from higher resourced schools. These four were differentiated by the length of their self-goals, namely the four coded from higher resourced schools had longer term self-goals such as college etc, whereas the others had more short term goals such as saving a sports team and cited self-goals as a secondary motivator.
Systemic barriers, including lack of opportunities, knowledge, time or resources, were identified as reasons for non-involvement, and understood by youth as evidence of their involvement being unwelcome (Ballard 2014, p17) . ; 
Lack of time or knowledge about becoming civically engaged and ; feeling too young to be influential; were also barriers (Ballard 2014,;p17).
Lack of empowerment was also identified as both a personal and systemic issue, and was experienced in particular ;by those in lowered resources schools (Ballard 2014, p17).
Ballard (2014, p17) concluded that youth generally have multiple motivations for civic engagement.
Self-goals could be linked to extrinsic motivations, such as resume building, as well as personal satisfaction such as positive feelings (Ballard 2014, p18).;
Ballard (2014, p18) identified invitations as a motivation, but acknowledged it was the least cited reason for engagement, suggesting that if it was done in combination with other motives, could serve as a useful avenue for engagement.
Ballard (2014, p18) distinguishes between involvement due to their beliefs about the importance of civic engagement and their involvement due to attachment to personal causes. Internal values as motivators have also been identified in previous research (Damon 2008 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p18), as has personal issues (Rubin 2007 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p18), but neither as unique, distinguishing motivations.
Youth from more highly resourced schools cited as their primary motivator the principle of civic engagement as important, despite acknowledging the existence of specific causes as secondary motivations. This was contrasted by motivations in lower resourced schools who demonstrated primary motivations to be the issues or causes themselves, reinforcing the lack of opportunities cited in the literature (Hart {\&}amp; Atkins 2002 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p19). Ballard (2014. p19) suggests that higher resourced schools are unlikely to relate personally to as many causes, whereas lower resourced schools emphasise civic participation as a means to create change, resulting in ;students seeing the results of social inequality and becoming engaged. The notion of young people identifying social inequalities and channelling their frustrations into civic action has also been identified by Flanagan (2009, p3).
Research has suggested that civic engagement takes different forms depending on the social contexts and the specific youth involved (Flanagan 2009; Kirshner, Strobel {\&}amp; Fernandez 2003; Sanchez-Jankowski 2002; Sherrod, Flanagan, Kassimir {\&}amp; Syvertsen 2005; Rubin 2007 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p19).
The opening up of opportunities (Kahne {\&}amp; Middaugh 2008; Levinson 2007; Youniss {\&}amp; Levine 2009 FYISEE Ballard 2014, p20) , as well as appealing to particular motivations and contexts, both need to be present to close the civic engagement gap (Ballard 2014, p20) 
Much research focuses on the importance of available opportunities, yet this alone is not likely to suffice in engaging all youth (Ballard 2014, p20). Most youth tend to be receptive to general principles of the importance of civic engagement or stirred into action by personally meaningful causes. Hence, youth need to be guided in their efforts to develop civically minded qualities and to identify with meaningful causes, which would serve to motivate initial and ongoing civic involvement (Ballard 2014, p20).
Individual youth are influenced to engage, or not, depending on their experiences, beliefs, interests, desires and concerns; those working with youth have an opportunity to recognise the principles and issues important to these youth and provide relevant opportunities (Ballard 2014, p21). In doing so, youth can initiate and sustain ;relevant and meaningful ;engagement, further developing relevant qualities and attitudes (Ballard 2014, p21);},

abstract = {This study frames continued long-term participation in community engagement activities as indicative of a sense of ‘purpose’ as defined by Damon, Menon, and Cotton Bronk (2003). Using data from US-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examined factors that predict whether students participating in civic engagement activities between the ages of 12 and 18 would report similar participation six years later. Multilevel logistic regression analyses revealed no demographic differences beyond age and highest level of education attained. However, continued participation was most likely among individuals who participated in a combination of voluntary and required community-based civic activities as an adolescent, and who participated in any of a number of various types of extracurricular activities. Other factors, including religiosity, sense of belonging in school, achievement, and having parents engaged in civic activities, were also positively related to continued community engagement.},
annote = {2013 Volunteerism as purpose.pdf
P3: Civic engagement can be conceptualised as an expression of positive youth development, as youth draw from internal and external resources to contribute to something that is both personally satisfying and socially beneficial (Sherrod, 2007)
P4: early participation,however, is not a guarantee of later participation (Vogelgesang {\&}amp; Astin, 2005)
P4: patterns of volunteerism across the transition from adolescence to adulthood, which is characterised as a time of change and potentially instability in positive development (Hawkins et al., 2011, in an analysis of Australian youth
P4: a sense of{\&}quot;˜purpose',defined by Damon et al. (2003) as{\&}quot;˜a stable and generalised intention to accomplish something that is at once meaningful to the self and of consequence to the world beyond the self'(p. 121)
P4: Damon and colleagues described purpose as being defined by three components: it is a stable and far-reaching goal, it is of benefit to one's self and to the greater good, and it is something at which one can make progress even if the outcome is unattainable
P4: Several longitudinal studies have examined changes in community involvement over the course of high school (e.g., Kerestes, Youniss, {\&}amp; Metz, 2004: Metz {\&}amp; Youniss, 2005; Reinders {\&}amp; Youniss, 2006), or afterwards (Rosenthal, Feiring, {\&}amp; Lewis, 1998); however, the strongest support for considering community
P5: engagement as a stable and far-reaching goal comes from studies that span the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. For example, Duke, Skay, Pettingell,and Borowsky (2009) and McFarland and Thomas (2006) related voluntary organi-sational involvement and school and family connexions among adolescents, respectively, to future civic engagement as a young adult using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth)
P5: As outlined by Damon et al.'s second tenet of purpose, one thing that may separate those who do and do not continue is a sense that the activity as important both internally and externally
P5: A student may participate in required activities to meet a goal of personal import (e.g., graduation)without considering what it means for the greater good, thus becoming likely to discontinue the activity once these personal motivations are taken away. 
P5: the issue of mandated community engagement,finding that truly voluntary activity was more predictive of future work with youth organisations than were required activities, and that the combination of the two (voluntary and required) was most predictive of civic volunteerism. Participants in either activity, however, were more likely to volunteer than were non-participants.
P6: they identified five areas worthy of further research into the construct of purpose. Of these, two areas (understanding of traditional introductions to youth purpose and identification of the purposes being supported by educational institutions) align with the notion that social-contextual factors work with personal characteristics to shape how purpose develops
P6: individual factors that have been studied in connection with youth purpose, including demographic characteristics, religiosity,and general well-being
P6: the authors highlight purpose in general, rather than looking at specific manifestations of purpose, as the authors mention that various types of purposes may appeal in different ways to specific groups of individuals. 
P6: t then stands to reason that community engagement as a form of purpose may appeal specifically to individuals of a certain gender, racial/ethnic background, or socioeconomic status (SES).
MY THOUGHT: I am not sure this is an obvious assumption, as it seems logical that different types of engagement, and not engagement in general, may appeal differently to certain groups or individuals.
P7: racial and ethnic differences in the frequency and nature of political engagement
P7: African American participants were the most likely to vote, make donations, belong to political groups, and raise money for charity; Asian Americans were most likely to volunteer regularly and work on community concerns. Cruce and Moore (2007) found that African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans First-year college students had greater odds of volunteering than did White First-year students
P7: youth from higher socio-economic backgrounds were more likely to volunteer
P7: The question, then, becomes whether such factors are related only to opportunity for initial exposure or whether they are related to continued participation once exposed.
P7: As was the case with SES, this suggests an importance in looking at both individual and contextual factors associated with religious influences 
P7: adolescents who belonged to religious groups were more likely to volunteer in community activities (McLellan {\&}amp; Youniss, 2003), and greater levels of religious activity were associated with greater civic engagement (Kerestes,Youniss, {\&}amp; Metz, 2004).
P8: participation in activities, especially{\&}quot;˜instrumental activities designed to contribute to a common good, was positively related to future civic and youth group engagement.
P8: Several researchers have commented that individuals who volunteer are more successful in school (e.g., Rosenthal et al., 1998).
P8: a psychological connection to school may foster a young person's sense of community in their proximal social context, which may lead them to want to be part of a broader community as they become young adults (see the{\&}quot;˜communities of practice a paradigm described in Wenger, 1998)
P8: In studies with high school students, those with parents and peers who were engaged in their communities were more likely to volunteer themselves (McLellan {\&}amp; Youniss, 2003; Mustillo, Wilson, {\&}amp; Lynch,2004)
P8: We were unable to find any that directly addresses well-being as a predictor of volunteerism among young people, although some work with older adults in Australia suggests a curvilinear relationship between the two (Windsor, Anstey, {\&}amp; Rogers, 2008).
P14: There Were also no significant differences when comparing racial/ethnic groups, nor was participation more likely among those with more educated mothers.
P15: compared to participants whose adolescent community engagement was solely{\&}quot;˜voluntary', those who reported that their participation was required by school, church, or families were significantly less likely to participate in volunteer activities as a young adult. 
P16: participants whose adolescent involvement was both voluntary and required by school/church/family were 1.60 times as likely to participate at Wave III than were the strictly voluntary adolescent participants, while participants whose involvement was voluntary and court-ordered (with or without additional outside requirements) were 1.71 times as likely to participate compared to the volunteer group.
P16: community engagement as a young adult was 1.22 times more likely among those participate in instrumental extracurricular activities than it was among non-participants, while young adult participation was 1.17 times more likely among participants in expressive activities than among those who do not participate. Athletes Were also 1.17 times more likely to participate than were non-participants. In addition, students who participated in hobbies more regularly were more likely to volunteer as young adults: for every 1 SD increase in self-reported hobby participation,students were 14{\%} more likely to participate in activities as a young adult. However, neither time spent watching television nor time spent with friends was significantly related to future community engagement.
P16: there was significant between-school variability in the likelihood of an adolescent continuing to participate in community activities as a young adult, neither school SES or school sector served to explain this variability. At the individual level, both sense of belonging and academic performance positively related to continued participation as a young adult. With each standard deviation increase in academic achievement, adolescents are 1.25 times more likely to serve as young adults, while odds of participation increased by 8{\%}for each standard deviation increase in feelings of belongingness in school.Wave I religiosity was also significantly related to community engagement at Wave III. With each standard deviation increase in religious involvement, adolescents likelihood of serving as young adults increased by 15{\%}. Friends Extracurricular activities, GPA, and sense of belonging were all non-significant predictors of young adult participation. However, students with parents who participated in civic activities were 1.20 times more likely to participate themselves as young adults.
P17: Overall, this suggests that differences lie not in terms of who finds purpose in community engagement, but rather more specifically in how that purpose is manifested.
P17: schools (and other educational organisations) may contribute to individuals self-motivation for future voluntary activities by providing activities in which students can experience feelings of competence, and in which they can develop a sense of relatedness by interacting with others who have similar interests. This importance of engaging in a supportive community is similarly illustrated by the fact that parental civic engagement and religious involvement were predictive of young people's continued activity as young adults.
P18: If students typically chose to participate in truly voluntary activities after participation in mandatory ones, it would speak to the role of schools in introducing otherwise non-engaged students into the community via the mechanisms described above.
P18: The question then becomes how best to design such programmes to encourage students to want to take this on individually.
P18: However, even if those participating in both types started out as voluntary before fulfilling mandatory duties, these findings speak to the role of schools in facilitating more sustainable interest in wanting to be engaged in one's community.
P18: another conclusion to take from this work could be that simply finding an activity of personal importance is more crucial for the development of a sense of purpose than is participating in a specific type of activity,
P18: suggesting that schools and other educational institutions should keep an open mind in terms of considering the many forms that community engagement may take.
P18: Students who earned better grades in school and who had a greater sense of belonging to their schools were more likely to serve as adults, 
P18: this is in keeping with the Communities of Practice paradigm (Wenger, 1998), which states that engagement in small communities prepares a young person for broader engagement later.

abstract = {This report aims to address the relationship between volunteering, active citizenship and community participation for young Australians. The project seeks to report those aspects of the relationship between students' demographic and school background variables, and active citizenship, which were conducive to greater participation. Variables considered include: gender, ethnicity, reading and writing achievement, socioeconomic status and geographic location.

annote = {2003 Active citizenship and the secondary school experience community participation rates of Australian youth.pdf
Highlighted on Page 6: International research indicates that those who begin volunteering young are most likely to continue volunteering through later stages of life: volunteering is a habit learned early.
Highlighted on Page 6: The study found that four variables significantly contributed to volunteering activity: gender, socioeconomic status, home language and size of home community.
Highlighted on Page 6: Girls spent more time volunteering than boys. In addition, girls volunteered more often if they were optimistic about their future prospects, while boys volunteered more often if they were pessimistic about the future. Girls were also more likely to volunteer if their mothers worked outside the home. This difference did not hold for boys.
Highlighted on Page 6: the greater the access to public knowledge, the more girls volunteered, and spent more time in volunteering. This was not the case for boys.
Highlighted on Page 7: Finally, girls who volunteered increased the amount of time they spent volunteering after they left secondary school, whether they went on to further study or not. Boys, in contrast, decreased their volunteering after their secondary studies. 
Highlighted on Page 7: for both genders, propensity to volunteer increased if the father was employed. Boys and girls from non-metropolitan communities volunteered more (more frequently and more hours) than youth from metropolitan communities, replicating an Australian pattern for all age groups. 
Highlighted on Page 7: Higher the socioeconomic level, the higher the score on accessing print media, a crucial component of access to public knowledge. 
Highlighted on Page 7: Those who remained in school did more volunteering than those who left school, those planning to do Year 12 did more volunteering than those not planning to do it. But as well, students at government schools did less volunteering (in frequency and hours) than students in either Catholic or independent schools. Finally, those who had finished high school and had gone on to study full-time volunteered more than those who were studying part-time. 
Highlighted on Page 7: A limitation of our data was that it did not make it possible to answer the 'why' of our questions
Highlighted on Page 7: Another question that merits further exploration is the impact of the rising number of hours in paid employment by young people, on the propensity to volunteer. 
Highlighted on Page 8: Volunteering - with its implication of altruistic service - has come to be seen as a most important instrument for the reinvention of active citizenship, although its social significance has kindled lively debate (Wilkinson and Bittman, 2002
Highlighted on Page 8: At the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, active citizenship has been persuasively advanced as an antidote to several dimensions of the societal disaggregation which, it is argued, adversely affects advanced industrial societies
Highlighted on Page 8: But active citizenship is most often seen as individual citizenship and focuses on the actions of the individual. 
Highlighted on Page 8: Wilkinson and Bittman (2002) returned the debate to a focus on society as a whole and democracy as a collective process, by arguing that active citizenship, particularly in its realisation through volunteering, is both individual and collective.
Highlighted on Page 9: {\^{a}}€˜passive{\^{a}}€™ reflects the idea that individuals experience these rights of citizenship, but are not called upon to engage personally in their construction or maintenance. 
Highlighted on Page 9: A volunteer is {\&}quot;someone who, in the last 12 months, willingly gave unpaid help in the form of time, service or skills, through an organization or group{\&}quot; (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2000:3)
Highlighted on Page 9: Second, a volunteer is someone who gives time without monetary compensation, to benefit others.
Highlighted on Page 9: Wilson (2000: 215) writes that volunteering is {\&}quot;any activity in which time is given freely to benefit another person, group or organization{\&}quot;.
Highlighted on Page 9: the current definitions of volunteering contain a contradiction. While volunteering is an activity in which time is given freely (without monetary compensation), there are situations in which the choice to volunteer is not entirely free
Highlighted on Page 9: Some secondary schools give course credit for volunteering, blurring the voluntary nature of volunteering with instrumental goals
Highlighted on Page 9: In Australia, so-called mutual obligation requirements mean that many welfare recipients are obliged to work in unpaid positions to maintain their payments. 
Highlighted on Page 10: The term 'passive' reflects the idea that individuals experience these rights of citizenship but are not called upon to engage personally in their construction
Highlighted on Page 10: Active or individual citizenship, on the other hand, focuses on the individual's actions to attain citizenship: her identification with, and engagement in, both the problems of her community and the collective construction of strategies and solutions to these problems.
Highlighted on Page 10: participation in networks, as an indicator of active citizenship. In this context, our study is situated at the crossroads of three international research debates about volunteering, active citizenship and youth. These debates are: 'Who volunteers? Predictors for adult volunteering' The role of social context in youth's propensity to volunteer' The relationships between academic success, volunteering and active citizenship.
Highlighted on Page 10: The question of whether volunteering has intrinsic value for social cohesion is rarely addressed within the literature, although the
Highlighted on Page 11: Question of whether 'a political' community involvement may reduce or substitute for political engagement, is a question addressed by American researchers (Campbell, 2000)
Highlighted on Page 11: Wilson (2000:215) summarised the different theoretical approaches to the role of volunteering as follows: Theories that explain volunteering by pointing to individual attributes can be grouped into those that emphasize motives or self-understandings... and those that emphasize rational action and cost-benefit analysis...Other theories seek to complement this focus on individual level factors by pointing to the role of social resources, specifically social ties and organizational activity. 
Highlighted on Page 11: In the UK 48{\%} of all men and women volunteered in 1997 (Davis-Smith 1998). In the US in 1998, the General Social Survey indicated a volunteering rate of 56{\%} (cited in Wilson 2000:216). The Australian Bureau of Statistics Study in 2000 indicated that of the Australian civilian population 18 years and older, 32{\%} volunteered some time in the past 12 months, up from 24{\%} in 1995. Australian rates are therefore significantly lower than the US or the UK, but in contrast to the UK, have risen rather than declined since the mid 1990s (ABS 2000: 4). In North America and the UK, the volunteering rates of adolescents tail off as they reach young adulthood, rise again to peak in middle age, and decline again after retirement. In the UK, the 1990s marked an increase in volunteering among the retired and a sharp decrease among the 18-24 year olds, a finding that sparked controversy. In the US, the decline among the young has not been marked. In Australia, the 1995-2000 period marked a considerable growth in volunteering among the 18-24 year olds (from 17{\%} to 27{\%}), and the 55-64 year olds (from 24{\%} to 33 {\%}) (ABS 2000: 6). 
Highlighted on Page 11: Internationally, women across all ages volunteer slightly more than men (Wilson 2000: 24). In the UK, the rate of volunteering was equal in 1997 (48{\%}), marking a slight drop for women since 1991 (Davis-Smith 1998). In Australia, the aggregate gender differences were slight in 2000, 31{\%} for men and 33{\%} for women. But gender differences emerge more clearly depending on age and life stage, with men volunteering slightly more than women in the older age groups, and considerably less in the youngest age groups. Partnered women with children had a significantly higher volunteering rate (45{\%}) than partnered women without dependent children (28{\%}) (ABS 2000: 3). Moreover, the activities that men and women do are highly gendered. Women dominate the education and welfare types of voluntary work while men maintain their numbers by their sporting voluntary work. 
Highlighted on Page 11: In the UK, twice as many people from the highest groups volunteered, as did those from the two lowest groups. Class and 
Highlighted on Page 12: socioeconomic status are also important variables in US and Australian studies (Institute for Volunteering Research 2002; Baer, Curtis {\&}amp; Grabb, 2001; Wilkinson {\&}amp; Bittman, 2002). 
Highlighted on Page 20: The Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of voluntary work (2000) found that young people tended to volunteer as a way of gaining work experience and new skills. But in this study, we found this was more likely to be true for boys than for girls.
Highlighted on Page 21: Qualitative research needs to be undertaken to find out how young people experience volunteer work. There were indications in this study that voluntary work leads to greater happiness in individuals but the details of how this is experienced could be teased out further. Research indicates that social networks provide embeddedness and social integration (Wellman, 1978; Cutrona, 1996) and voluntary work is one way of providing individuals with these networks.

abstract = {In 1999, the province of Ontario joined a number of other jurisdictions in requiring its high school students to complete a period of community service as a condition for graduation. All students entering high school in Ontario must now complete 40 hours of community service before they graduate.1 The primary objective of this program and others like it around the world is to address declining civic engagement within society. Civic engagement is a multi-dimensional concept reflecting people’s psychological and associational attachment to their communities. It incorporates such aspects of good citizenship as a sense of civic responsibility, a network of social connectedness, attentiveness to public life, and a willingness to contribute to achieving society’s collective goals. It is believed that mandating community service in adolescence will develop these civic orientations and motivate young people to continue volunteering after they have graduated. But to what extent or under what circumstances do mandatory community service programs accomplish these goals? In this research report, we venture preliminary answers to this question},

Five contemporary pathways for youth civic engagement are described: public policy/consultation, community coalition in-volvement, youth in organizational decision making, youth organizing and activism, and school-based service learning.

First year students (33 in a course with a service-learning experience, 27 in the same course without this component) and upper-class students (n = 25) in upper-level service-learning courses were compared. Results suggested that Values and Understanding motives were most important, and Protective and Social motives were least important across college volunteers. Females rated Values, Understanding, and Self-Esteem motives more important than did males, and service-learning students rated Values and Understanding motives more important than did nonservice-learning students. Values, Protective, and Social motives were predictive of overall satisfaction with the service experience. Results have implications for recruitment, satisfaction, and retention of student volunteers.},

P3: Values and Understanding motives were most important, and Protective and Social motives were least important across college volunteers. Females rated Values, Understanding, and Self-Esteem motives more important than did males, and service-learning students rated Values and Understanding motives more important than did non service-learning students. Values, Protective, and Social motives were predictive of overall satisfaction with the service experience. 
P9: Values and Understanding motives appeared to be most important within and across subsamples. Again, these motives suggest a need to act on one’s personal values and beliefs about the importance of helping others and to understand those served and oneself in relation to those served, respectively. 
P10: Although the Values and Understanding motives were rated as most important generally, they were not rated as the most important motives by every individual in the sample.
P10: Overall, 54{\%} of entire sample rated the Values motive as most important,32{\%} rated the Understanding motive as most important, 20{\%} rated the Ca-reer motive as most important, and 12{\%} rated the Self-Esteem motive as most important.
P10: Women rated the Values(t[31]= 2.81, p = .009), Understanding (t[31] = 2.01, p = .05), and Self-Esteem (t[31] = 2.19, p = .04) motives significantly more important than men did in the Fall sample
P10: The overall importance of motives does not change with service,as evidence in this table. The ranks of motives are identical to those obtained before service.
P12: The Values, Protective, and Social motives significantly predicted overall level of satisfaction with service, and accounted for 43{\%} of the variability in satisfaction scores. As the importance of acting on one’s personal values and beliefs about helping others increased, overall satisfaction increased. The more service helped to alleviate aversive feelings, the more satisfaction experienced. The greater the value placed on meeting the expectations of others, the less satisfaction experienced. It appears that the service experience did not fulfill this particular motive.
P12-4: The more importance one placed on the need to act on personal values and beliefs about helping others, the more satisfied one was with duties. The greater the value placed on meeting expectations of others,the less satisfaction experienced regarding duties performed.
P14: Understanding motive was a significant predictor of satisfaction with level of interaction with other volunteers at the site, and accounted for approximately 19{\%} of the variability in this satisfaction rating.
P14: The more important the motive to learn about and to understand those served(or oneself in relation to those served), the greater the satisfaction with the level of interaction with other volunteers at the site.},

abstract = {Interest in focus group discussions has grown recently, and so has the recognition of them as a valuable method for qualitative data collection. Despite increasing popularity, they are not an easy option, and moderators must find appropriate ways to approach participants to achieve good-quality data. A path to reach this aim is the inclusion in the focus group agenda of some "exercises" (or activity-oriented questions) that are enjoyable and productive supplements to questions. Exercises provide a different way of gathering information and are beneficial, for instance, for more reflective participants. They can help focus the group's attention on the core study topic and also make subsequent comparative analysis more straightforward. They can also be helpful with young people and to discuss sensitive topics. The author describes and provides suggestions for use and examples of several exercises, illustrating their application in a research project investigating the cultural meaning of youth suicide in university students in Italy, India, and Australia.},

Highlighted on Page 7: Sentence completion. Sentences on the topic areprepared in advance, printed on paper, and distributedto the participants, who are given a few minutes tocomplete them and share the results with the group(Krueger, 1998).
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; insti-tution, flyer, or project), participants might be asked,“If it was a person, which kind of person would itbe?” {\&}quot;:
If I were an institution in this ideal society, what kind of institution would I be? How do I behave? How do I think?
Comment on Page 8, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Participants areasked to list their ideas on paper. These are then trans-ferred to a large sheet or whiteboard, and participantsgroup similar suggestions on the same sheet and choosea name for each category of items. After asking foradditional items that might belong to the categories, themoderator invites participants to examine the lists andpick a given number of items (Morgan, 1998), such asthe three most important, the five most likely, the fourleast known, and so on, or can ask to rate all items.Furthermore, the elements for the triad test or rankingcan be developed in a free-listing task. Techniques canbe merged in many different ways! {\&}quot;:
Multitask exercises - participants are each given a number of post-it notes on which they can write elements of their ideal society, these are then brought together and grouped into categories and each category is named. The categories and the items within the categories can then be ranked to identify capabilities.
Highlighted on Page 8: The members of the group are asked to develop a cam-paign, write a slogan, or design an advertisement linkedto the topic. Participants are provided with materials torealize it (cards, papers, colors, magazines, photographs,boxes, materials for hobbies, etc.). They might also bedivided in small groups, and each of them presents itsown campaign and provides comments on those of theother groups. Those in the focus group plan the strategy,complete with slogans, music, or whatever they think isneeded to be effective (Krueger {\&}amp; Casey, 2000). Youthcan plan a campaign aimed to persuade other youths todo or to not do something. Application of this techniquecan be in different areas, such as increase awareness ofa problem or disease or promote a community activity,health services, and programs. 
Highlighted on Page 8: silent con-versation (Groundwater-Smith {\&}amp; Mockler, 2003).Basically, participants are asked to comment onsomething; then they are given large, separate sheetsof paper where they write their ideas. Once this hasbeen done, they look at other’s responses and expressagreement or disagreement or elaborate on a point. All of this is done in silence (although for any activity-oriented question it is always better to give room to dis-cussion). The benefit of the silent conversation in thiskind of situation is that it ensures that even the quietestparticipant is heard.
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Free ListingsAn easy but very powerful strategy to stimulatediscussion is to ask participants to produce a list(Bernard, 1995). As noted by Bernard, this techniqueis often used to study a cultural domain. The moder-ator invites participants to list all elements of adomain, for example issues that need intervention,solutions to a problem, or characteristics of a certaintopic. {\&}quot;:
Activities to encourage and stimulate discussion may include free listings (participants list elements that might contribute to a particular problem or solution), ratings (listed items can then be rated in terms of importance or relevance), ranking (items can be ranked against each other),... Each activity can be used to explore the issue in more detail - why is that more important than this, and what criteria did you use to make that assessment?
Highlighted on Page 3: RatingRating scales are powerful data generators (Bernard,1995). Among other things, Krueger (1998) sug-gested that they can help identify which items shouldbe discussed in more detail. Participants have a list ofitems (e.g., words, objects, or pictures) that must berated on a scale, usually composed of a range ofnumbers or adjectives. The adjective ratings can takethe form of a semantic differential.
Highlighted on Page 4: RankingIn this task, participants generally receive a list ofterms, written on cards or on a whiteboard, to rankaccording to a specified dimension; for example, fromthe most likely to the least likely, from the most accessi-ble to the least accessible, or from the least dangerous tothe most dangerous. A different ranking task could takethe form of a paired comparison (Bernard, 1995); that is,all the items are combined in pairs, and participants are asked to say which item is “the most... ” o r “theleast . . .” compared to the other element of the pair. 
Highlighted on Page 4: Pile SortingPile sorting is usually a card-sort task in whichrespondents sort cards (representing elements of adomain) into piles according to their similarity to anddifferences from each other. Pile sorts are typicallydone with cards or papers, but they can also be donewith objects (e.g., cultural icons, tools) and pho-tographs or pictures from magazines. After the sorting,the moderator might ask what the items grouped in thesame pile have in common and generate discussion.Two questions that participants are often asked are“What do you mean by similar?” and “Can any elementgo in more than one pile?” (Bernard, 1995, p. 249).
Highlighted on Page 4: Choosing Among AlternativesAs indicated by Krueger (1998), this is a populartechnique in focus groups. Participants are offered var-ious alternatives and are asked to discuss the advan-tages and disadvantages for each of them and select theone (or two, three) that they believe is the most appro-priate, useful, and so on.
Highlighted on Page 5: Magic Tools and FantasyDreams, magic, and fantasies can successfully beintroduced in a focus group session. For example, tomake participants think about possible strategies forprevention or solution to a problem, the moderatorcan say that he or she has a wand, hat, or device thatwill make their dreams or ideas become true. He orshe then passes around the tool (even just symboli-cally), and each participant shares the fantasy, dream,or idea (Krueger, 1998). Kruger and Casey (2000)observed that this question often works well becauseit is different from what participants expect, but it isessential that the moderator plan the experience sothat participants are ready for it.
Highlighted on Page 6: Another Variation: Role-PlayingThere are circumstances in which participantsmight not be able to describe verbally how theywould behave or react in a situation, solve a problem,or deal with a difficulty as it is requested, forinstance, in the storytelling exercise but can demon-strate it in action. In those cases (but potentially alsoin others), role-playing is the perfect technique. Inthis activity-oriented question, one or two partici-pants pretend to be in a certain situation, and the restof the group observes how they behave. At the end ofthe role-play, participants are asked to share theirobservations and reactions (Krueger, 1998).

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the links between identity (statuses and processes) and adolescent civic engagement (volunteer and political participation). Participants were 392 Italian high school students (42{\%} males) aged 14-20 years (. M age = 16.23 years; . SD age = 1.53) who completed a self-report questionnaire. First, using a person-centered approach, we found that achieved adolescents were more involved in volunteer activities, reported higher civic efficacy, and stronger aspirations to contribute to their communities than their diffused counterparts. Second, by means of a variable-centered approach, we demonstrated that the link between identity processes (i.e., commitment and in-depth exploration) and past and future volunteer and political participation was mediated by social responsibility. Implications of the findings for current understanding of the link between adolescent identity formation and civic engagement are discussed and suggestions for future research are outlined. ?? 2011 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.},
annote = {2012- Identity and civic engagement in young people.pdf
Highlighted on Page 1: During adolescence, individuals face the task of developing a firm personal identity and figuring out their place in society (Erikson,1950,1968)
Highlighted on Page 1: Facing this identity task is vital to becoming responsible adults and active citizens (Havighurst,1952). 
Highlighted on Page 1: One recent empirical study on the topic suggests that identity and civic engagement seem to reinforce each other time, creating a virtuous cycle in which identity promotes civic engagement and engagement fosters identity (Hardy, Pratt, Pancer,Olsen, {\&}amp; Lawford, 2010).
Highlighted on Page 2: Erikson's lifespan theory of psychosocial development (1950, 1968) was a pioneering contribution to the field of identity studies. According to this theory, identity formation is the core developmental task of adolescence. Adolescents may move toward two poles, represented by identity achievement and identity confusion.
Highlighted on Page 2: Marcia's (1966) identity status paradigm. Based on his clinical work, Marcia proposed that the two poles distinguished by Erikson (i.e.,identity achievement vs. identity confusion) could be incorporated into a broader model, based on the dimensions of exploration and commitment. Exploration refers to the active questioning and weighing of various identity alternatives before making decisions about the values, beliefs, and goals that one will pursue. Commitment involves making a relatively firm choice about an identity domain and engaging in significant activities geared toward the implementation of that choice.
Highlighted on Page 2: Crossing exploration and commitment yields four identity statuses (Marcia, 1966). In the achievement status, individual shave made a commitment in a specific identity domain following a period of active exploration; in the foreclosure status,adolescents have geared to a commitment with little or no prior exploration; in the moratorium status, adolescents are actively exploring various alternatives and have not yet made a commitment;finally, in the diffusion status adolescents have not engaged in a proactive process of exploration of different alternatives, nor have they made a commitment in a specific identity domain.
Highlighted on Page 2: In the last decades various expansions of Marcia's model have been proposed (cf.Schwartz, 2001). In particular, Meeus,Crocetti et al. (Crocetti, Rubini, {\&}amp; Meeus, 2008; Meeus, van de Schoot, Keijsers, Schwartz, {\&}amp; Branje, 2010), building upon previous works by Meeus (1996; Meeus, Iedema, Helsen, {\&}amp; Vollebergh,1999), have expanded the identity status paradigm by proposing a three-factor identity model, focusing on the interplay of commitment which refers to firm choices that adolescents have enacted with regard to various developmental domains and the self-confidence they derive from these choices; in-depth exploration which represents the extent to which adolescents reflect on their current commitments, looking for new information about them and talking with other people about their commitments; and reconsideration of commitment which refers to the comparison of present commitments with possible alternative commitments when one's existing commitments are no longer satisfactory. This conceptualization of reconsideration of commitment is, in some respect, similar to Marcia's(1966)original definition of exploration, as it encompasses the search and evaluation of possible new commitments. On the other hand, it differs from exploration in that it taps into adolescents; present attempts to change current commitments because they are no longer satisfied with their prior choices. Therefore, reconsideration is undertaken within the context of one's present commitments, rather from a lack of commitment as originally hypothesized by Marcia.
Highlighted on Page 2: In fact, this three-factor model, in contrast to Marcia's(1966) conceptualization, assumes that individuals enter adolescence with a set of commitments in ideological and interpersonal identity domains (Meeus, 2011; Meeus et al., 2010). For instance, in domains such as educational and relational identity, individuals approach adolescence with some commitments(usually internalized from parents or other authority figures) and can decide whether to maintain or to revise them. Thus, thismodel is based on the interplay of a dual cycle process (cf.Luyckx, Goossens, {\&}amp; Soenens, 2006): adolescents can then explore their commitments in depth and decide whether they provide a good fit with one's overall goals and potentials (the identity development and maintenance cycle); if one's current commitments are not satisfying or do not provide a good fit, they maybe reconsidered in favor of other more appealing commitments (the identity revision cycle).
Highlighted on Page 3: such activities influence the formation of beliefs about one's responsibilities and aspirations toward community (e.g.,Pancer, Pratt, Hunsberger, {\&}amp; Alisat, 2007; Schmidt, Shumow, {\&}amp; Kackar, 2007).
Highlighted on Page 3: Such research focuses on the importance of early socialization processes in contexts of families, schools, and peer groups as well as on opportunities for civic involvement during adolescence (Flanagan, 2003b; Youniss {\&}amp; Levine, 2009; Youniss, McLellan, {\&}amp; Mazer, 2001). 
Highlighted on Page 3: civic efficacy (the belief that one can impact their community)
Highlighted on Page 3: social responsibility (a sense of duty to others)
Highlighted on Page 3: both lead to and result from participation in community service and political activities (Flanagan, 2003a; Pancer et al., 2007; Schmidt et al. 2007).
Highlighted on Page 3: growing literature has showed that identity plays a key role in explaining moral motivations, the basis of prosocial behaviors (cf.Hardy, 2006; Hardy {\&}amp; Carlo, 2005, 2011a,b).
Highlighted on Page 3: Pancer et al. (2007) tested relations between identity development and youth civic involvement. 
Highlighted on Page 7: Findings suggest meaningful links between identity and community volunteer activities and moderate associations between identity and political participation.
Highlighted on Page 9: achieved adolescents were more involved in volunteer activities,reported higher civic efficacy, and had stronger aspirations to contribute to their communities than their diffused counter-parts, while adolescents in the early closure and moratorium statuses displayed intermediate scores. 
Highlighted on Page 9: Results suggest that identity commitment and in-depth exploration of identity choices are positively related to social responsibility which, in turn, is positively associated with past and, to a stronger extent, future volunteer engagement. This suggests that the attitude of social responsibility is a potential mechanism by which higher order identity processes are related to community-oriented civic engagement.
Highlighted on Page 9: the identity process of in-depth exploration, more than identity commitment, related to civic engagement (through the mediation of social responsibility). Thus, the active reflection on current commitments seems to be the key identity process that might promote civic engagement, perhaps through the formation of attitudes such as social responsibility.
Highlighted on Page 9: in-depth exploration can be a double-edge sword, associated with curiosity but also with confusion and distress (e.g., Luyckx et al., 2008; Schwartz, Zamboanga, Weisskirch, {\&}amp; Rodriguez, 2009).
Highlighted on Page 9: civic engagement andidentity likely affect each other in reciprocal ways (e.g.,Hardy et al., 2010)
Highlighted on Page 10: youth who face few opportunities for civic engagement are less likely to be civically engaged (e.g.,Youniss {\&}amp; Levine, 2009).
Highlighted on Page 10: adolescents with a mature identity might find volunteer involvement to be a suitable context for expressing their will to be active in their communities, whereas the same cannot be said for political involvement. 
Highlighted on Page 10: adolescents who are politically involved are negatively evaluated by their peers who are not involved. Indeed, politically involved adolescents are often perceived by other adolescents as fanatic or easily manipulated by older politicians (Graziani, 2004)
Highlighted on Page 10: Most likely, there is a reciprocal relationship between identity and civic engagement: identity promotes civic participation which stimulates achievement of an even more firm identity. Therefore, future longitudinal studies are needed to disentangle these links.

abstract = {The field of psychology has been slow to recognize the importance of purpose for positive youth development. Until recently, purpose was understood, if at all, as a means of adapting to threatening conditions rather than as a motivator of good deeds and galvanizer of character growth. Moreover, in most psychological studies, purpose has been conflated with personal meaning, a broader and more internally oriented construct. This article offers a new operational definition of purpose that distinguishes it from meaning in an internalistic sense, and it reviews the existing psychological studies pertinent to the development of purpose during youth. The article identifies a number of urgent questions concerning how-and whether-young people today are acquiring positive purposes to dedicate themselves to and, if so, what the nature of today's youth purposes might be.},
annote = {2003- The Development of Purpose During Adolescence.pdf
Highlighted on Page 3: proactive as well as reactivesources of human motivation (see Seligman {\&}amp;Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).
Highlighted on Page 3: positive psychologists reject the idea that people's goals and values arise from basic drives such as hunger and sex, or from defense mechanisms such as sublimation and reaction formation. People can and do choose goals and val-ues that promote higher purposes, such as purposes ofcreativity, morality, and spirituality.
Highlighted on Page 3: positive psychologymovement use constructs such as {\^{a}}€{\oe}authentic happiness{\^{a}}€(Seligman, 2002), {\^{a}}€{\oe}creativity{\^{a}}€ and {\^{a}}€{\oe}optimal experi-ence{\^{a}}€ or {\^{a}}€{\oe}flow{\^{a}}€ (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), and {\^{a}}€{\oe}ulti-mate concerns{\^{a}}€ (Emmons, 1999) to capture the essenceof our most lofty and enlightened desires.
Highlighted on Page 3: Identity theorists, from Erikson (1968) toLoevinger (1976), have marked adolescence as the pe-riod in the life-span when people first begin to dedicatethemselves to systems of belief that reflect compellingpurposes.
Highlighted on Page 3: The clinical ob-servations of Erikson and his followers demonstratethat, when young people find nothing to dedicate them-selves to while growing up, it becomes increasinglydifficult for them to acquire motivating belief systemslater in life (Erikson, 1968; Marcia, 1980).
Highlighted on Page 3: Research has shown that the personal effects of purposelessness may include self-absorption, depression, addictions, and a variety of psycho-somatic ailments, and the social effects may include deviant and destructive behavior, a lack of productivity, and an inability to sustain stable interpersonal relations (Damon, 1995).
Highlighted on Page 3: it is likely that purpose dur-ing youth leads to a number of desired outcomes,such as prosocial behavior, moral commitment,achievement, and high self-esteem. Theory and re-search on the emergence of moral identity during ad-olescence is consistent with this hypothesis (Damon{\&}amp; Gregory, 1997).
Highlighted on Page 3: some young people be-gin to define themselves in moral terms during the adolescent years, and in doing so they often refer to grand belief systems (Damon, 1983; Damon {\&}amp; Hart,1992; Hart {\&}amp; Damon, 1988)
Highlighted on Page 3: virtually all major theories portray young people as adapting to these {\&}quot;fact of life{\&}quot; (or 'markers') variables through low-level emotional or behavioral responses such as anxiety and stress avoidance, aggression, attachment and affiliation, popularity and status-seeking, shame and guilt,and achievement motivation for narrowly defined tasks such as school tests.
Highlighted on Page 4: Frankl (1959) himself used meaning and purpose in-terchangeably. He refers to purpose as 'inner strength'(p. 76), as that which is ultimately responsible for the state of one's inner self, as that which has an 'inner hold'(p. 78) on the moral and spiritual self and as the 'why'(p. 88) or reason for living, that motivates a person's life .
Highlighted on Page 4: Ryff and Singer(1998), for example, stated that having purpose in lifemeans {\^{a}}€{\oe}feeling that there is meaning in one{\^{a}}€™s presentand past life{\^{a}}€ (p. 707).
Highlighted on Page 4: Baumeister's discussion of purpose or {\&}quot;purposiveness{\&}quot; for example, considered it to be one of the 'four needs of meaning' alongside value, efficacy, and self-worth (Baumeister, 1991): Purpose is therefore one piece of the bigger picture of meaning.Similarly, Reker and Wong (1988) used purpose asone of the three descriptors of personal meaning.They see purpose as a side of a triangle of factors that constitute personal meaning, in which meaning is defined as 'the cognizance of order, coherence and pur-pose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment' (p. 221).
Highlighted on Page 4: Emmons's (1999) discussion of goals, motivations, and strivings, for instance, he claimed that goals that serve as a source of personal meaning can provide 'unity and purpose' (p. 147) to peoples' lives
Highlighted on Page 4: Benard (1991) pointed to a number of psychological outcomes specific to purpose, including goal-directedness, achievement, motivation, educational aspirations, healthy expectations,persistence, hopefulness, and a sense of a compelling future.
Highlighted on Page 4: 1. Purpose is a goal of sorts, but it is more stableand far-reaching than low-level goals such as{\^{a}}€{\oe}to get to the movie on time{\^{a}}€ or {\^{a}}€{\oe}to find a park-ing place in town today.{\^{a}}€2. Purpose is a part of one's personal search for meaning, but it also has an external component,the desire to make a difference in the world, to contribute to matters larger than the self. 3. Unlike meaning alone (which may or may notbe oriented towards a defined end), purpose isalways directed at an accomplishment towardswhich one can make progress.
Highlighted on Page 4: Using the 'fantasy life of adolescents, found in the diaries,{\^{a}}€es-says not written for public consumption' and other intimate documents Inhelder and Piaget (1958, pp.340-345) found that adolescents reflected on purpose without any prompting
Highlighted on Page 6: Inhelder and Piaget (1958) concluded that the expressions of lofty aspirations, which they had observed in adolescents” such as becoming great thinkers, world leaders, and solution-finders for humanity's deepest philosophical and societal problems 'were merely manifestations of youths' 'egotism' or a 'sophisticated game of compensation functions' (pp. 344-345).
Highlighted on Page 7: Fry (1998) observed that purpose, as interpreted as nonselfish and other-oriented, is salient for youth. Fry's interviews revealed that most youths 'evaluation systems' although biased toward self-enrichment,combined with concerns of cooperation with others outside of themselves.
Highlighted on Page 7: In an examination of the post adolescent years, a study by Daloz, Keens, Keens, Parks, and Parks (1996) traced the lives of individuals who committed themselves to the common good and concluded that it is important for self-development in all phases of life for people to dedicate themselves to causes greater than the self. The findingis in accord with an earlier study by Colby and Damon(1992) that looked at adults with high levels of moralcommitment.
Highlighted on Page 7: Inhelder and Piaget's (1958) work showed how adolescents express their other-oriented aspirations in grandiose and intense manners,
Highlighted on Page 7: sometimes the life programs that youth adopt have 'a real influence on the individual's later growth, and it may even be that a person discovers in his adolescent jottings an outline of some ideas which he has really fulfilled since (pp. 334{\^{a}}€“335).
Highlighted on Page 7: Erikson{\^{a}}€™s (1968) observations on the developmental significance of belief systems for adolescent identity formation and the life choices that follow.
Highlighted on Page 7: studies suggest a relation between lower scores on the PIL and drug involvement (Noblejas de la Flor, 1997; Padelford, 1974), young peoples{\^{a}}€™ participation in risky and antisocial behaviors, (Sappington {\&}amp; Kelly,1995; Sayles, 1994), and alcoholism (Schlesinger,Susman, {\&}amp; Koenigsberg, 1990; Waisberg {\&}amp; Porter,1994). On the more positive side, the PIL has been related to young people's commitment to social action (Butler, 1968) and is a mediating factor between religiosity and happiness (French {\&}amp; Joseph, 1999)
Highlighted on Page 7: Chinese Purpose in Life question-naire (C-PIL), Shek, Ma, and Cheung (1994) discov-ered that youth with lower purpose more frequentlyengage in antisocial behaviors and are more aggres-sive. Shek (1993) found in another study that highscores on the C-PIL were predictive of psychologicalwell-being in Chinese undergraduates. Battista and Almond's (1973) Life Regard Index suggested that experienced meaning in life correlates with self esteem, although it has been observed that results with this scale and its revised form (Debats, 1998) are un-certain (Harris {\&}amp; Standard, 2001). Antonovsky{\^{a}}€™s(1987) Orientation to Life Questionnaire has also generally found associations between coherence or purpose and physical and psychological health.
Highlighted on Page 9: Among the questions that the scholarship needs to answer are as follows: 1. What noble purposes have inspired young people throughout the course of history? 2.

abstract = {For youth to benefit from many of the developmental opportunities provided by organized programs, they need to not only attend but become psychologically engaged in program activities. This research was aimed at formulating empirically based grounded theory on the processes through which this engagement develops. Longitudinal interviews were conducted with 100 ethnically diverse youth (ages 14–21) in 10 urban and rural arts and leadership programs. Qualitative analysis focused on narrative accounts from the 44 youth who reported experiencing a positive turning point in their motivation or engagement. For 38 of these youth, this change process involved forming a personal connection. Similar to processes suggested by self-determination theory (Ryan {\&} Deci, 2000), forming a personal connection involved youth's progressive integration of personal goals with the goals of program activities. Youth reported developing a connection to 3 personal goals that linked the self with the activity: learning for the future, developing competence, and pursuing a purpose. The role of purpose for many youth suggests that motivational change can be driven by goals that transcend self-needs. These findings suggest that youth need not enter programs intrinsically engaged--motivation can be fostered--and that programs should be creative in helping youth explore ways to form authentic connections to program activities.},

P1: For youth to benefit from many of the developmental opportunities provided by organized programs, they need to not only attend but become psychologically engaged in program activities. 
P1: this change process involved forming a personal connection
P1: youth need not enter programs intrinsically engaged-motivation can be fostered-and that programs should be creative in helping youth explore ways to form authentic connections to program activities.
P1: the relation between program participation and positive outcomes may be particularly strong for youth from economically disadvantaged backgrounds (Mahoney etal., 2009; Marsh, 1992; Pedersen {\&}amp; Seidman, 2005).
P1: In order for youth to obtain most of these developmental benefits, however,they need to not only join programs but become psychologically engaged in the programs' activities. By psychologically engaged,we mean being motivated to a degree that their attention is absorbed in the tasks and challenges in an activity (e.g., in creating an effective work of art, learning a software program, providing effective service to the community; cf. Blumenfeld, Kempler, {\&}amp; Krajcik, 2006).
P1: To improve the likelihood that all youth will gain the developmental benefits afforded by program activities, researchers should understand the processes through which youth's engagement can develop.
P1: Although there is a large body of research and theory on motivation in young people, researchers know little about how motivation (particularly engagement of attention)changes and develops in this or other contexts (Wigfield, Eccles,Schiefele, Roeser, {\&}amp; Davis-Kean, 2006).
P1: We asked what happened within these youth's conscious experiences in programs that {\&}quot;got them motivated,{\&}quot; {\&}quot;psyched,{\&}quot; or increased their engagement in program activities?
P2: Higher levels of interest,intrinsic motivation, or engagement are related to indicators of more and deeper level learning (Blumenfeld et al., 2006; Eccles {\&}amp; Wigfield, 2002).
P2: In a longitudinal study, Mahoney, Parente, and Lord(2007) found that observational ratings of children's (M age 8.4 years) engagement (paying attention, demonstrating interest in the activities) in nine after-school programs were related to significant increases in leader-rated social competence and in effectance motivation (the intrinsic pleasure a child derives from solving difficult problems) over a school year.
P2: Shernoff (2010) showed that middle school students' reports of psychological engagement during program activities (obtained through experience sampling) mediated the relationship between program participation and social competence.
P2: a large computer-assisted survey, Hansen and Larsen (2007) found that when high school students indicated being intrinsically motivated in a youth program, they reported having significantly more positive developmental experiences.
P2: The principle focus of most current literature on motivation is not on engagement but rather on factors that influence individuals' decisions about the future, most often about school and career choices (Eccles {\&}amp; Wigfield, 2002; Wigfield et al., 2006).
P2: However, some of the factors found to influence these decisions-individuals' values, short- and long-term goals, expectations about their performance in an activity, prior experiences, self-beliefs,parents' beliefs-may also directly or indirectly influence the development of engagement. Eccles's (2005) expectancy-value theory provides a useful inclusive empirically based framework that integrates many of the factors that predict performance, persistence, and task choice into a single model.
P5: Learning for the future. The largest number of youth (17 from eight programs) attributed the change in their psychological engagement to a connection they discovered between the skills they were learning through participating in program activities and goals for their future.
P6: Rickman (2009) described the youth's process as that of “finding fit”: It involved a dual process of learning about potential career opportunities through the program and evaluating how these matched their own skills and interests.
P6: Developing a sense of competence. A second group of youth(six from three programs) attributed their increased psychological engagement to the sense of competence they were developing as a result of doing well in program activities. While the prior group of youth made connections to the future, these youth made connections to goals in the present. Doing well in program activities-and having that acknowledged by others-provided meaningful self-affirmation. 
P6: Doing well, getting affirmation from others,and having opportunities to repeat these experiences appeared to have increased these youth's engagement in programs' activities.
P6: Pursuing purpose. The third group of youth (15 across four programs) attributed their increased psychological engagement to forming personal connections to goals that transcended their own self-interest. For youth in three leadership and service programs,these were moral, civic, and social change goals (similar to those that engaged youth in our pilot study). For youth in a faith-basedprogram, it also included religious goals. The motivation to worktoward these goals fit Damon's (2009) definition of purpose. It involved {\&}quot;a stable and generalized intention to accomplish something that is at the same time meaningful to the self and consequential to the world beyond the self{\&}quot; (p. 121).
P7: (Ryan {\&}amp; Deci, 2000). According to SDT, as an individual comes to internalize the goals of an activity, his or her motivation becomes more self-determined, and psychological engagement becomes stronger. In the present study, the development of a personal connection appeared to have a similar role. Youth Attributed their increased engagement to changes in themselves and their perceptions of the activity that made the activity personally meaningful. Our findings differ from SDT, however, in the centrality of underlying psychological needs in driving this change process. The analyses of youth's accounts identified only one of DT's three basic psychological needs, competence, as central to their experience of personal connection.
P7: The parallels with SDT, nonetheless, help us understand the strong effects that personal connections appeared to have on youth's behavior. According to this theory, when individuals become identified with an activity and its goals, they experience more ownership of the activity and investment in its outcomes(Ryan {\&}amp; Deci, 2000).
P7: research shows that people whose connection to an activity is more internalized are more likely to engage at a
P8: deeper level and demonstrate more resilient engagement (Ryan {\&}amp; Connell, 1989).
P8: Our findings suggest that when youth do begin to connect to meaningful career paths, it can create a marked increase in their motivation and engagement.
P8: Our Findings suggest that as youth internalize the value of a program activity and build a network of connections between the activity and future goals (e.g., by learning techniques and sensibilities for being an effective teacher), the tasks and challenges of the activity can become genuinely interesting, which, in turn, may support deeper learning.
P8: Damon, Menon, and Bronk (2003)argued that humans can proactively choose and be motivated by goals that are “of consequence to the world beyond the self” (p.121). Indeed, mid adolescence is an age period when some young people begin to define themselves in moral terms and in reference to grand belief systems (Erikson, 1968). Damon et al. proposed that this type of emergent identity can become a powerful motivator for pursuit of goals that-though important to the self-are not reducible to self-needs (see also Damon, 2009; Youniss, 2009).Youth in our study, whose change involved purpose, described forming personal connections between this emergent moral or religious identity and the missions of their programs to seek social change or serve religious goals. Importantly, the change they described involved not just acquiring a rational motive to continue participating; it created psychological engagement.
Comment on Page 8, on highlighted text {\&}quot; what is most likely to increase youth’s psychological engagement is when a program successfully connects with their earnest and serious side {\&}quot;:
Whilst many programs aim to attract youth through {\&}quot;fun{\&}quot; activities or material gains, the research suggests the most effect means to engagement is connecting with their {\&}quot;earnest and serious side{\&}quot; (p266).
P8: The results suggest that motivation develops through youth’s internal conversations (or conversations within the group)about, first, “Who am I (or we), and what do I (or we) want to achieve or become?” and, second, “What personal or transcendent goals are served by participation in program activities?” Engagement appears to increase when the answers to these two questions become interconnected.
P8: If confirmed with further research, this model of motivational change indicates that programming and program leaders should engage with youth's personal values and goals, and help them explore multiple opportunities to find and develop authentic personal connections to activity choices.},

The achievements and limitations of Indian democracy are assessed in this light, with special attention to the adverse effects of social inequality on democratic practice. It is argued that while the quality of democracy is often compromised by social inequality and inadequate political participation, democratic practice itself is a powerful tool of elimination of these handicaps.},

Methods: Data are from Wave 1 (1995) and Wave 3 (2001-2002) of the in-home interviews from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The sample for this study included 9130 young adults aged 18-26 years. Linear and logistic regression models were used to measure the influence of connection in family and community contexts (Wave 1) on outcomes of civic engagement in young adulthood (Wave 3). Results: Stronger connection in all family and community contexts during adolescence predicted greater likelihood of voting, community volunteer service, involvement in social action/solidarity groups, education groups, and/or conservation groups, and endorsement of civic trust in young adulthood. Select connections in family and community contexts were also significant predictors of political voice/involvement and blood product donation. In a final multivariate model, frequency of shared activities with parent(s) and school connection during adolescence emerged as unique predictors of young adult civic engagement. Conclusions: Connections in family and community contexts during adolescence promote healthy youth development through facilitation of multiple aspects of civic engagement in young adulthood. The importance of these connections in fostering youth capacity to bond to a broader community construct is discussed. ?? 2009 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

These are all questions related to what psychologists call identity. Many theorists have argued that we are driven to answer these questions, particularly during adolescence. In this article, I summarize an expectancy value perspective on identity and identity formation. Within this framework, identity can be conceptualized in terms of two basic sets of self perceptions: (a) perceptions related to skills, characteristics, and competencies, and (b) perceptions related to personal values and goals. Together these two sets of self perceptions inform both individuals’ expectations for success and the importance they attach to becoming involved in a wide range of tasks. Within this perspective, then, I focus on the role personal and collective identities can play on motivated action through their influence on expectations for success and subjective task values. I also discuss briefly how personality and collective identities develop over time.},

But here we enter the domain of ethical values. Identity and fidelity are necessary for ethical strength, but they do not provide it in themselves. It is for adult man to provide content for the ready loyalty of youth and worthy objects for its need to repudiate. As cultures, through graded training, enter into the fiber of young individuals, they also absorb into their life-blood the rejuvinative power of youth. Adolescence is this a vital regenerator in the process of social evolution; for youth selectively offers its loyalties and energies to the conservation of that which feels true to them and to the correction or destruction of that which has lost its regenerative significance.{\&}quot; (Erikson 1994, p126)},

Starts page 293 in google books, 2009 version
Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Psychological and sociological theorists consider youth a politically definitive period. This is a time in life for deciding about the direction of one’s future. In the process, an individual tends to take stock of him/herself and his/her society. Whereas childhood and early adolescence tends to be highly structured, the transition to adulthood is marked by the young person’s greater self determination and independence of thought. {\&}quot;:
The period of youth, according to sociological and psychological theorists, is a time for understanding themselves and their society, to figure out who they want to be, and a time of increasing freedoms, self-determination and independent thought (Flanagan 2008, p1).
Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Erikson (1968) captured the developmental imperatives that youth face when he described the key psychosocial tasks of these years as exploring and consolidating an identity. This entails seeking purpose, deciding on beliefs and commitments, and linking to others (in organizations, religious traditions, or social causes) who share such commitments. Developing an ideology enables youth to organize and manage the vast array of choices the world presents {\&}quot;:
Development in many of these areas are linked with Erikson's notion of identity development, and are often informed by purpose, beliefs and commitments and association with groups or causes who might share a particular ideology (Flanagan 2008, p1).
Highlighted on Page 6: Third, although social rewards are the reason most youth initially join organizations, over time they are likely to develop an affinity and identification with the organization and its mission, and feel a sense of coherence between their own values and views and those of others in the organization (Erikson, 1968). The public or collective identity they are forging is a necessary foundation for sustained civic action insofar as such action benefits the community, not just the self. We are more likely to forego individual gain on behalf of the good of a group if we feel a sense of solidarity with the group.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the Adolescents' Interpretation of the "Social Contract" project. This project focused on the roots of citizenship and the ways that young people develop a commitment to the commonwealth. By the social contract, the authors refer to the set of mutual rights and obligations binding citizens with their polity. They contend that there is an intergenerational bargain implied in the process of social integration, that is, a promise that one will enjoy the rights and reap the benefits of the social order if he or she lives by its rules and fulfills the responsibilities of membership. The authors also argue that engagement in the voluntary sector connects young people to the broader polity, and, in that process, they develop an understanding of themselves as civic actors, engaged in the issues and capable of addressing the problems of their polity. The findings are based on a survey of more than 5,600 12–19-yr-olds from 7 countries (Australia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia, Sweden, and the US).

abstract = {Social workers in diverse community practice settings recruit and work with volunteers from religious congregations. This article reports findings from two surveys: 7,405 congregants in 35 Protestant congregations, including 2,570 who were actively volunteering, and a follow-up survey of 946 volunteers. It compares characteristics of congregation volunteers and nonvolunteers.Volunteers tended to be married, older, more highly educated, longer-term congregational members, and to score higher on all measures of faith maturity and faith practice than did nonvolunteers.Volunteers perceived their involvement as meaningful, important, and challenging. A large majority of volunteers (80 percent) reported changes in faith, attitudes and values, and behavior as results of their volunteer work. Findings provide insights into how religious individuals begin and continue to volunteer in service settings and how congregations promote high levels of community service among their members. These findings have implications for effective social work practice with congregation volunteers.},

Highlighted on Page 1-2: Volunteers tended to be married, older, more highly educated, longer term congregational members, and to score higher on all measures of faith maturity and faith practice than did nonvolunteers. Volunteers perceived their involvement as meaningful, important, and challenging.A large majority of volunteers (80 percent) reported changes in faith, attitudes and values, and behavior as results of their volunteer work when compared with nonvolunteers, volunteers are more likely to be more highly educated (Chambre, 1984), to have higher incomes (Gronbjerg {\&}amp; Never, 2002; Park {\&}amp; Smith, 2000), to be working part-time (although retirement is not related to volunteering) (Gronbjerg {\&}amp; Never, 2002; Park {\&}amp; Smith, 2000), and to be married (Uslaner, 2002). Variables significantly associated with the decision to volunteer include previous volunteer experience (Caro {\&}amp; Bass, 1997; Chambre, 1987; dye, Goodman, roth, Bley, {\&}amp; Jensen, 1973); a religious identity passed on from parents (Park {\&}amp; Smith, 2000); more reflective disposition, less concern with material aspects of life, and greater need for contemplation and prayer (Gerard, 1985); better health and a greater preference for active pursuits rather than spending long periods of time watching television (Gerard, 1985); an attitude of forgiveness (wuthnow, 2000); and simply being invited to volunteer (Bowman, 2004; Park {\&}amp; Smith, 2000; roehlkepartain, Naftali, {\&}amp; Musegades, 2000). In addition, several factors appear to sustain volunteer involvement, including being connected with other volunteers (Cnaan, Boddie, Handy, yancey, {\&}amp; Schneider, 2002; M. C. Nelson, 1999), receiving multiple forms of social support for the volunteer activity (Ashcraft {\&}amp; Kedrowicz, 2002), and having the opportunity to develop genuine relationships with service recipients (Lawrence, 2000).
Highlighted on Page 2: the most important motivation for volunteering was wanting to act on one's values. Volunteers often report that religious beliefs are important motivators for their involvement (Hodgkinson {\&}amp; weitzman, 1994).
Highlighted on Page 2: Unruh (1999a) has noted three 'modes of religious meaning' in faith-
Highlighted on Page 2: based service: (1) gratitude for what the volunteers perceive God has done for them, (2) obedience to God's will, and (3) opportunity for encountering God. Bender (1997) concluded that the extent to which volunteers connect what they are doing with their religious belief systems is important
Highlighted on Page 2: one of the roles of those who work with volunteers, then, is helping them to articulate their motives in language that resonates with their beliefs and values (wuthnow, 1995).
Highlighted on Page 2: This language is all the more important for religious volunteers because the expectation that faith should lead to service pervades religious thought (Campolo, 1983; Hessel, 1988; r. A. Nelson, 1990). dykstra (1999) described the activities ”referred to as 'practices of faith' ”that collectively constitute a life of faith for Christians
Highlighted on Page 2: Some practices also are related directly to volunteer service: providing hospitality and care to strangers, suffering with and for one another and neighbors, specific acts of service, and activities that promote social justice.
Highlighted on Page 2: religious thought suggests that faith and service have a dynamic, transactional relationship. For example, according to the Christian Protestant re-former Martin Luther, the effects of faith are twofold: justification (with God) and service (to neighbor). In fact, faith and service are so closely related in Luther's thought that 'it is impossible, indeed, to separate (them), just as it is impossible to separate heat and light from fire' (Mcelway, 1990, p. 176). Faith motivates volunteers to serve, and serving, in turn, may deepen and transform the volunteer's faith, leading to a greater commitment to service, compassion for those who suffer in unjust social systems, and the potential for more radical engagement in the community
Highlighted on Page 5: Compared with nonvolunteers, volunteers in this sample were significantly more likely to be female (59.4 percent, n = 2,037), highly educated (bachelor's degree or higher 53 percent, n = 1,817), older (M = 45.5), married (60.9 percent, n = 2,095), and more involved in gainful employment (hours/week M = 34.8).
Highlighted on Page 5: Volunteers have been members of their congregations significantly longer (M = 13 years, n = 3,212, SE = .23) than have nonvolunteers (M = 10.9 years, n = 3,260, SE = .21; t = 6.80, df = 6,470, p = .000). Significantly more congregation volunteers (61.4 percent, n = 2,067) attended worship and other congregation activities more than once a week, on average, than those who did not volunteer (33.1 percent, n = 1,123) [{\"{I}}‡2(4, N = 6,763) = 579.73, p = .000]. Volunteers reported that they have participated in community service for an average of 12.4 years (SD = 11.9 years, n = 861) and that they had provided an average of 5.2 years (SD = 5.8 years, n = 870) of service in their current service setting.
Highlighted on Page 5: For each hour worked at employment, the probability of being involved in volunteering declined by 1 percent. For each additional year a person had been a member of the congregation, the probability of service involvement increased by 1.1 percent.
Highlighted on Page 5: volunteers in these congregations parallel other researchers' descriptions of volunteers' ”that is, that more highly educated people and people working part-time are more likely to volunteer.
Highlighted on Page 6: when asked whether they agreed that 'my life is filled with meaning and purpose,' there was no significant difference between volunteers and nonvolunteers. Volunteers (M = 20.4, n = 3,435, SE = .07) indicated significantly higher levels of motivation to serve than did nonvolunteers (p {\&}lt; .01; M = 17.8, n = 3,540, SE = .08). Volunteers scored significantly higher than nonvolunteers on all measures of faith maturity and practice,
Highlighted on Page 6: It is clear that these volunteers overwhelmingly see their service as an opportunity to share their faith with service recipients, but how that sharing takes place varies from verbalizing their faith to expressing it in actions.
Highlighted on Page 6: The service activity occurred on the congregation's premises for 40.8 percent (n = 343) of volunteers.
Highlighted on Page 6: respondents reported that congregations were most likely to provide publicity and financial 
Highlighted on Page 7: support and least likely to provide spiritual guidance related to their volunteerism (see Table 2).
Highlighted on Page 7: More than half of the respondents (n = 548) noted that leaders never (24 percent), rarely (17 percent), or only once in a while (11 percent) encouraged them to think about and discuss their expectations or to reflect critically on their experiences. Fewer than one-fourth of volunteers (22 percent, n = 211) re-ported that their congregation leaders often provided them with supportive and challenging feedback. In short, most congregations provide their volunteers with publicity, financial support, and recognition. More than half of the volunteers know that others in the congregation are praying for them, but only a minority receive any spiritual guidance related to their involvement, even though they are motivated to serve by their faith.
Highlighted on Page 7-8: In short, most of these volunteers reported a wide diversity of changes in their knowledge, values, and faith as a result of their service to the community, and open-ended responses indicated that these changes were experienced as positive.
Highlighted on Page 8: changes in behavior, values, and faith as outcomes of their volunteering. These changes motivate continued and even increased service involvement.
Highlighted on Page 8: More challenging experiences have the greatest impact on volunteers' faith' ”whether the challenge is relating to service recipients who are different from self, serving in a setting that demands new skills or knowledge, or being in unfamiliar territory. 
Highlighted on Page 9: Social workers may be so concerned about the potential of volunteers sharing their faith inappropriately with service recipients that they actually seek to uncouple service and faith rather than to encourage the volunteers to reflect on the connections. Such conversation and reflection can provide a way to assess the appropriateness of the volunteer's faith expressions with the service recipients and tap into resources that can sustain volunteers, even, and maybe especially, when the service is difficult and 'success' is hard to define.
Highlighted on Page 9: Higher levels of faith maturity and practice were significantly associated with opportunity to intentionally reflect on and integrate the service experience with religious beliefs and values. Unfortunately, volunteers in our sample reported that they were infrequently offered such experiences. Thus, they have missed a step in the service experience that could deepen the faith that initially motivates and later sustains their service.
Highlighted on Page 9: Those who have had bad experiences or have been burned out in volunteering experiences probably had stopped volunteering or were less likely to complete the Volunteer Survey.},

It has brought attention to a much wider range of information on people's freedoms and well-being than in most earlier economic planning; but it also has troubling features and requires modification and enrichment. This paper first identifies the approach's components, the contributions of the HD Reports, and the doubts about whether SCA has a sufficient conception of human personhood to sustain work on HD beyond finding indices superior to GDP. It then examines SCA's central concepts. The concepts of capability and functioning lead us to consider both possibilities and outcomes, but their definition and use has been confusing. Besides Sen's opportunity concept of 'capability' we must distinguish skills and potentials; and distinguish levels and types of 'functioning'. To understand both consumerism and what can motivate and drive more humanly fulfilling development, we must elaborate different aspects and sources of 'w...},

Location would, ideally, be a classroom or other space located in the schools, as this provides a sense of familiarity and accessibility for the participants (Gibson 2007). The location would provide seating and adequate space for collaborative activities.
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The style and format of group discussion requires somethought to standardise coverage and analysis as well as allowing for an accuratetimetable of events to be shared with participants at the recruitment stage {\&}quot;:
The focus groups will need to occur 2-3 times; this will provide sufficient time for discussions to reach adequate depth, and provide both participants and facilitator reflection time between sessions. The subsequent sessions will also include an initial time at the beginning of the session to recap the previous session, to ensure accuracy and boost their recollection to provide more fruitful discussion. The schedule for sessions will be provided to participants during the recruitment stage (Gibson 2007).

The approach torecording is an important inclusion in information sheets as familiarity and confidencewith various methods will vary in children and young people and may lead tounnecessary anxiety . {\&}quot;:
The focus groups will be video recorded. This would allow the facilitator to focus on facilitating the discussion instead of taking notes, and would allow particular participants to be identified for analysis (which would prove more difficult with audio). To reduce possible anxiety, the use of video recording will be included in the information sheets and mentioned at the commencement of the session and placed as inconspicuously as possible in the room.
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Other supplementary materials needed for the group also require some thought,specifically where activities are included {\&}quot;:
Supporting activities will also require supplementary materials such as butchers paper, markers, adhesive putty, sticky notes, etc.

Finally, allowsufficient time for piloting both to minimise the necessity for new data collection andto avoid collecting excessive amounts of data.
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; . Largergroups of up to eight are possible with older children (Horner, 2000). But too large agroup may limit all children participating (Green and Hart, 1999; Roose and John,2003). It is more difficult to recommend the least number of participants, as even withfour young people in one of our studies rich data was still possible (Edwards et al.,2003). Probably four to five participants are ideal with younger groups (Morgan et al.,2002). The tension regarding size is not to be too small otherwise parallel interviewsmay result, or too large for a moderator to maintain the focus of discussion (Hennessyand Heary, 2005). Unlike research involving adults (Fern, 1982) the effect of groupsize with children and young people has not been described. {\&}quot;:
As noted by Gibson (2007), group size for effective discussion with young people has not been identified, however they do suggest that for older children 8 is possible. Since this research is aimed at early adolescence, a group size of 10-12 is hoped to provide adequate dialogue and not limit all youth participating.
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; There should only be 1–2 yearage difference between participants, since style, ability, sensitivities and level ofcomprehension and abstraction differ substantially at different ages (Kennedy et al.,2001). {\&}quot;:
To avoid significant variances in ability and levels of comprehension, the groups will consist of students from the same year, and a number of groups would be done in each school to cover years 7-9 (ages 12-15).
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Gender is more often the focus fordiscussion with homogeneity often recommended (Heary and Hennessy, 2002).However, both single and mixed gender groups have been successful (Hill et al.,1996). {\&}quot;:
Gender is also a consideration: the research hopes to understand different gender perspectives, and accordingly will include some single sex groups and some mixed gender groups. This might be accomplished through single sex schools, or by selecting group composition based on gender.
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Distractionsfor the researcher should also be avoided such as windows overlooking high trafficareas, telephones and busy wall decorations (Dilorio et al., 1994). {\&}quot;:
To avoid distractions, the researcher will request that all mobile devices be placed on silent or turned off for the duration of the session (Gibson 2007 FYISEE Dilorio et al., 1994).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Making children and young people feel welcome and reducing their anxiety aboutparticipating begins at the stage of recruitment. Successful early engagement willestablish a way of working and interacting with children and young peoplethroughout your study. Both verbal and written communication should establish arelationship based on respect and valuing their contributions. It will be important toput participants at their ease as soon as they arrive at the venue. Use of first names andinformal introductions to other participants and to the venue will be important. Familymembers should also be introduced and welcomed as they will need to feel confidentthat they are leaving their child in safe and comfortable surroundings. Informationsuch as provision of food and drinks, and the time to collect their child should all bereaffirmed. Mobile phone contact should be established, to reassure both familymembers and participants. The facility for children and young people to leave thegroup before it concludes must be in place. There are many reasons why they maychose to leave, not all of which can be anticipated in advance. Creating earlyopportunities for making choices and participate in decisions will establish asupportive relationship in which they will feel able to speak out and express theirneeds (Shier, 2001). A further strategy is to have a member of your research teamavailable if they do decide to leave the group, this foresight might reassure familymembers that their child’ s need’ s will be attended to at all times.This role is also usefulto attend to the needs of late arrivals, and thus limits ‘other things’ that could distractthe moderator. {\&}quot;:
Establishing a conducive and comfortable atmosphere will begin from recruitment (Gibson 2007). Early conversations, it is hoped, will create some familiarity between the facilitators and participants, and assure them that their contributions are valued. Initial sessions will include some {\&}quot;get to know you{\&}quot; activities, as well as remind participants that they are allowed to leave at any time, and the procedure for that (which will need to be established in consultation with the school).
Highlighted on Page 5: Room size, light, temperature and seating arrangements can all affect the groupdiscussion (Krueger, 1998). Ensuring comfort, encouraging an informal atmosphere,minimising distractions and maximising interactions must all receive some attention.

It is hoped that a large meeting room or an average sized classroom can be secured to provide adequate space, and chairs arranged in a circle or around a table or cluster of tables to encourage interaction and project a non-authoritarian atmosphere (Gibson 2007).
Highlighted on Page 5: Seating arrangements should beplanned in advance to maximise interactions among the participants and maximiseobserver involvement (Dilorio et al., 1994).
Highlighted on Page 5: A circular arrangement may be best andpermits the group moderator(s) to sit among participants projecting a non-authoritarian climate.
Highlighted on Page 5: Choosing to sit on chairs or on the floor will be an age-dependent question: whatever you think will give a relaxed and informal atmosphere.The inclusion of a table is personal choice, but it can make children and young peoplefeel less self-conscious (Hennessy and Heary, 2005). Seating provides anotheropportunity to introduce an element of choice.
Highlighted on Page 6: Once seated and general introductions have taken place we have found ice-breaker’sto be another useful method to put children and young people at their ease, with otherparticipants as well as the moderators. Ice-breakers serve a number of functions. Theygive everyone an opportunity to practice saying something in the group, makeparticipants feel relaxed and establish an environment in which sharing and listeningare valued. The format of ice-breakers is varied, although they must be age specific andensure some continuity to the design of the actual focus group. How much time youhave available might well influence how creative, active and participatory you want theice-breaker to be.
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; A child-friendlyrepertoire, including patience, warmth, humour, respect, active listening andflexibility are skills found to be particularly useful. Being non-judgmental andadaptable are also qualities that will promote participants’ trust in the moderator andincrease the chance of open and interactive dialogue (Gibbs, 1997). {\&}quot;:
The facilitator/s would need to encourage participation and listening between group members; this would require patience, respect, active listening, flexibility, humour and a non-judgemental attitude (Gibbs 1997 FYISEE Gibson 2007).
Highlighted on Page 7: Introducing the groupAs many children and young people may not have participated in a focus group,although ‘circle time’ in schools is fairly commonplace, clarity from the start is crucial.A standard statement read aloud to each group is highly recommended to ensure eachgroup receives the same information and nothing important is missed out.

Since many participants will not have been involved in a focus group before, the initial introduction will need to clearly expound the goals and procedures of the sessions.
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The format and nature of thegroup discussion will need to be outlined in this statement, alongside reminders aboutconfidentiality and what this means in a way that children will understand. Someground rules are helpful such as avoiding talking at the same time, how to attractattention when wanting to speak, and that there are no right or wrong answers as thisis not a test (unlike classroom work). Making it clear why they have been asked toparticipate, the aim of the discussion and how long the group will last are allimportant issues to remind about at this stage. Explaining the role of the moderatorand assistant moderator is important to reduce any suspicion children may have of‘strangers’, particularly strangers who are not speaking and scribbling in a notebookas is often the role of the assistant moderator. Other methods of recording also needto be explained and verbal permission to use taping equipment sought. Details abouthow the focus group will end, whether the assistant moderator is to provide asummary , and how you will de-brief are also important points. The key points of yourstatement can be displayed on flipchart paper, you might also choose to engage yourparticipants at this stage and ask if they have anything to add to the ground rules. {\&}quot;:
The goals, format, character and confidential nature of the sessions will be discussed in this introduction, as well as duration and procedures of the discussion. An explanation of the role of the facilitator, and participants questions and comments will be welcomed (Gibson 2007).
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Conducting and recording the discussionThe initial opening question and the sequencing of questions that follow must be wellthought out. A pre-determined structure, listing the topics to be discussed, that allowsfor flexibility and space for participants to offer contributions on topics important tothem, particularly for young children, is preferred to working strictly through a seriesof questions. Exploring emerging issues and diversity of view requires the moderatorto be spontaneous and adaptable. Approaches to presenting questions should also beconsidered, with the use of ‘what’ or ‘how’ questions preferred to ‘why’ questions andthose that initiate ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses. Relevant, sensitive probes for explanation,checking meaning and clarification are helpful {\&}quot;:
The discussion will then follow a set of pre-determined, open questions which explore key areas of community, an ideal future, and participation. The facilitator will explore ideas, clarify meaning and probe for explanation when necessary (Gibson 2007). Questions will generally be directed to the entire group, instead of individuals, to avoid anxiety, and activities that elicit every individuals opinions will also be utilised to ensure full participation (Gibson 2007).
Highlighted on Page 8: Using phrases such as, ‘what does everyone else think’, ‘does anyonethink something different’ as opposed to directing a question at an individual whomay be shy is a preferred method. Or going round each member of the group andcalling on the children by name can be a useful strategy with young children whomight be excited and all talking at once (Kennedy et al., 2001).
Highlighted on Page 8: Using children’s namesalso aids transcription, most important when children will have moments of speakingover one another.
Comment on Page 8, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Using exercises and activitiesA further decision to be made in the planning stage is the inclusion of exercises oractivities. Their inclusion is an excellent strategy to maintain children’s concentrationand interest as well as enabling participants to work together (Hennessy and Heary,2005). They can also be helpful as a fun warm-up session when children first arrive ata group. Your decision will be based on the way in which you want the discussion tobe organised, reflective of your study and overall aim. Time available will be animportant factor. Younger children can be kept focused on an activity for about 45minutes to one hour, whereas older children and young people, with good moderatorskills, will maintain focus for about 90 minutes. {\&}quot;:
According to Gibson (2007), older children are able to concentrate for up to 90 minutes, and since this is likely to match well with most school {\&}quot;double periods{\&}quot;, it will be the desired session time.
Highlighted on Page 9: A ‘secret box’ in which participant’s post their views isjust one approach to bear in mind (Punch, 2002).
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Thanking children for their contribution at the conclusion of the group is animportant message that shows respect. Similarly receiving feedback about the resultsof a study in an appropriate format also values their participation. In one study we usedregular newsletters to keep participants informed of progress (Gibson et al., 2005b).Children have commented frequently about the lack of feedback they receive, such asone young person who had been treated for cancer: ‘I have taken part in lots of studies,but I never hear anything about what happened, that’s so annoying’ (personalcommunication).This is another opportunity to work with children and young peopleto design feedback that is relevant, interesting and appealing. In one study we workedwith a reference group of children who commented on both recruitment and feedbackmaterials, with a definite benefit to both style and content (Gibson et al., 2005b). {\&}quot;:
Acknowledging the contribution of the youth is also crucial, and reinforces the value of their participation; this could be a verbal thanks at the conclusion of the session, as well as feedback on the results of the research in a relevant and accessible format (Gibson 2007).
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Working within an ethical frameworkNumerous guidelines are now available to steer both novice and experiencedresearchers when working with children and young people (Neill, 2005). Thequestion of ethics is not however unique to this method. Specific to the method aretwo factors, that disclosures by participants are shared with group members and notonly a research team, and that intense group discussion may give rise to stress ordistress in individuals (Smith, 1995; Hennessy and Heary , 2005; Goodman and Evans,2006). Safeguarding participants in focus groups is a priority . The ongoing consentingprocess is one place to emphasise these issues. What disclosure and confidentialitymean will need to be discussed with children and young people, their understandingchecked and recorded in research notes (Ungar et al., 2006). Once explained toparents/family members they can support the research team in explaining the termsusing real examples from their own lives, which will make it easier for young childrento grasp.Avoiding stress or distress cannot be guaranteed. Both participants and familymembers will need to be reassured of how you will identify and monitor stress levels,how you will intervene and manage any situation that arises. Assuring participants andothers in the consenting process about moderator training, experience working withchildren and young people, and the role of debriefing to discuss reactions to {\&}quot;:
ETHICS - Participants and consenting adults will need to be aware that participants can remove their consent at any time, as well as physically remove themselves from the group discussion. They will also be made aware about past experiences and training the facilitator has had in relation to young people, as well as Working With Children checks completed.
Highlighted on Page 10: discussions will help to alleviate any worries. Having a third person from your researchteam available to be with participants for a period outside of the group if anyoneappear to be upset can also be reassuring.},

abstract = {American 16- and 17-year-olds ought to be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This claim rests upon a line of argument that begins with an exegesis of legal and philosophical notions of citizenship that identify core qualities of citizenship: membership, concern for rights, and participation in society. Each of these qualities is present in rudimentary form in childhood and adolescence. Analyses of national survey data demonstrate that by 16 years of age—but not before— American adolescents manifest levels of development in each quality of citizenship that are approximately the same as those apparent in young American adults who are allowed to vote. The lack of relevant differences in capacities for citizenship between 16- and 17-year-olds and those legally enfranchised makes current laws arbitrary, denying those younger than age 18 the right to vote. Awarding voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds is important, given the changing age demographics in the country, which have resulted in the growing block of older voters displacing the interests of younger Americans in the political arena. Finally, the authors critically examine claims that adolescents are neither neurologically nor socially mature enough to vote responsibly and conclude that empirical evidence and fairness suggest that 16- and 17-year-olds ought to be awarded the vote.},
annote = {The evidence presented here suggests that the voting threshold ought to be set at age 16. There is rapid development in many qualities related to citizenship and voting in early adolescence up to age 16 and then slow development thereafter. Adolescents in this age range are developmentally ready to vote. This pattern is in accord with research on adolescents’ reasoning and cognitive abilities, which suggests that development in these areas plateaus at age 16.},

The primary objective of this program, and others like it around the world, was to address declining civic engagement within society. Using a quasi-experimental design, we explore the impact of mandatory volunteering on its stated aims. Our findings suggest that volunteering in high school has positive impacts on the political dimensions of a student's subsequent civic engagement, measured here as political involvement, political activism, political interest, and political efficacy. However, those impacts are largely conditional on two features of the volunteering experience: sustained commitment to one placement and a positive experience as evaluated by the student. High school community service seems to be unrelated to social dimensions of civic engagement, measured here as involvement in a variety of social, cultural, and religious organizations.},

Highlighted on Page 19: The main factors are types of relationships with other people. The parents have very strong influence on the youths' church attendance patterns, mostly through their own behavior, not through conscious efforts to socialize their children into the church. Peer pressures have strong influence on youth program participation and attitudes toward the youth programs. Relationships with church leaders are very important influences on overall attitudes about the church. It is important that whether the youth reported liking or disliking their religious education in the past few years was more determinative of their present participation and attitudes than either the number of years of their religious education or the knowledge gained (measured by our test of Bible knowledge). We found that parents have a strong influence on their children's church attendance but almost no influence on their children's attitudes toward the church and toward church youth programs. Also the amount of parent-child tension turned out to be quite unimportant, contrary to our expectation. The hypothesis that church rejection is a psychological extension of parent rejection was at best very weakly supported. Attitudes of church rejection expressed by some youths were traced largely to a dislike of past religious training and to perceptions of church leaders as unapproachable, insincere, or uncertain about expressing their own beliefs. Attitudes of rejection of church youth groups were traced mostly to experiences of being snubbed or rejected by the other youth, to peer pressures contrary to church

Among the most important are the capacities to take initiative in a creative and disciplined manner; to think systematically in understanding problems and searching for solutions; to use methods of decision-making that are non-adversarial and inclusive; to deal efficiently and accurately with information rather than respond unwittingly to political and commercial propaganda; to make appropriate and informed technological choices and to develop the skills and commitment necessary to generate and ap-ply technical knowledge; to organize and engage in ecologically sound production processes; to contribute to the effective design and management of community projects; to put into place and to participate in educational processes conducive to personal growth and life-long learning; to promote solidarity and unity of purpose, thought, and action among all members of a commu-nity; to replace relationships based on dominance and competition with relationships based on reciprocity , collaboration, and service to others; to interact with other cultures in a way that leads to the advancement of one’s own culture and not to its degradation; to encourage recognition of the essential nobility of human beings; to maintain high standards of physical, emotional and mental health; to imbue social interaction with an acute sense of justice; and to manifest rectitude in private and public administration.

Democratic citizenship should be conceived of as a cosmopolitan virtue which must find expression through practical means. (p5)
Modern citizenship is often characterised by work participation, family commitments and national pride, sometimes outweighing the inclination towards defending human rights. Isin {\&}amp; Turner argue the inherent compatibility of citizenship and human rights. (p5)
Citizenship has been understood in other spheres in terms of freedom, authority, rights, laws and obligations. (p6)
Struggles of citizenship have traditionally centred around social class, gender and race. (p7)
Struggles of citizenship were distorted by traditional ideas of social class, gender and race. (p7)
Redistribution and Recognition are two fundamental forms of struggle around citizenship. (p7)
Identity is intrinsically connected to citizenship. (p8)
The decline of active citizenship, with its volunteer and community engaged mentality, coincides with the rise of individualism antagonistic to human rights development. (p8)
There is a percieved contradiction between human rights and citizenship derived from the relationship between the sovereignty of the state and its inalienable right to bestow citizenship. (p12) Hence, social rights are only acknowledged within the framework of the state, whereas human rights stem from the vulnerability of human existence and are disconnected from any responsibilities. (p12)
Since human rights are generally invoked only as remote forms of protection, social rights as bestowed by citizenry provide security as standard, and consequently should complement, not compete with human rights. (p13)
Human rights focus on entitlement, whereas citizenship acknowledges an entitlement that arises from an assumed contribution. (p16)},

This article explores this important process for youth that participate in the PeaceJam Ambassadors program. High school-aged ‘PeaceJammers’ study the lives of Nobel Peace laureates while creating projects to affect change in their local communities. Multiple methods were used to access youth perceptions including surveys and interpretive interviews. Participants reported high levels on indicators on personal and social change. Their narratives articulated salient influences on their identities and actions. They shared how advisors promote social identity, participation, and the development of moral identities. These findings add to a growing empirical literature on moral development and youth engagement in peace education and community transformation.},
annote = {2014 Promoting the development of moral identity, behavior, and commitment in a social action program.pdf
P3: Societal conceptions hold adolescents as adults-in-transition or as works-in-progress(Wyn and White 1997). Indeed, social narratives favor a picture of youth as dependents, devoid of prosocial goals, direction, and purpose. But there are voices that are re-scripting this narrative, advancing a view of youth as powerful agents of social transformation (see Ginwright, Noguera, and Cammarota 2006). Emerging work suggests that as youth engage in activities related to social action and justice, there can be transformative experiences for the individual and the community (Ginwright And James 2002; Lewis-Charp, Yu, and Soukamneuth 2006), as youth recognize and strengthen the links between their own self-representations and behavioral commitments within the community.
P4: symbolic interactionist theories emanate from sociology and social psychology and hold that individuals seek to explore and confirm a sense of self through interactions in proximal settings, and that behavior is informed by self-conceptions and representations (Blumer 1969). Youth are actors in diverse settings and often face difficult choices maintaining a sense of cohesion among differing roles and responsibilities.
P4: Moral identity has been described as a self-consistent dedication to patterns of behavior that benefit others (Hart, Atkins, and Ford2010). Amoral identity is present when individuals understandings of their identity are based upon moral values (Blasi 1993; Hardy and Carlo 2005). According to Reimer (2005, 263),{\&}quot;˜The developing child must learn to reconcile moral reasoning and self-understanding in order to successfully navigate complicated social situations, instances that require both automatic and agentic responses.'As such, moral identity has consistently been viewed in tandem with moral behaviors and actions, thus considering situ-ated self-representations is essential for understanding moral behavior in context.
P4: Damon (1988) suggested that morality evolves in relational context, and that the quality of moral reactions is influenced by the nature of relationships. Community service and social action experiences present instances to confront moral dilemmas. Kohlberg, Levine, and Hewer (1983)considered these experiences necessary in moral development because they promote pivotal reflections and open new understandings and perspectives. Moral issues are inherent in interpersonal relations, are embedded in academic curricula, and are expressed in the community. In these contexts, moral dilemmas become opportunities for choice and judgment where youth reevaluate their own
P5: self-representations as they confront issues of oppression, unfairness, inequality, and truth. Consistently, the principles of justice and care are core to structures of morality (Gilligan 1993; Hersh, Paolitto, and Reimer 1979).
P5: collective action through service can promote group identification that informs individual roles. The adoption of a social identity may instigate changes in personal identities (Stets and Burke 2000), as social identities imply a range of roles and responsibilities that can lead to a (re)consideration of involvement in community activity and long-term goals (Wentzel 1996). Personal, role, and social identities motivate action (Eccles 2009). As such, advisors and adults facilitating community activity for youth can play an active role in promoting moral and prosocial identities. Youniss and Hart (2005) described the joint influence of intergenerational collaboration and social identity in service activity{\&}quot;“together these factors can promote the construction of the moral self.
P5: Community service and out-of-school activities can provide the space to both express and revise identities. Eccles and Barber (1999) noted that individuals make decisions about activity participation in part due to the expectancy of success in the ability{\&}quot;˜to demonstrate to oneself and to others that one is the kind of person one must hopes to be.'Participation in community service can be a powerful motivator for youth as they define their lives, and the construction of a civic identity can promote social belongingness as one situates the self in the larger population (Kirshner 2009). Indeed, by participating in these kinds of activities, teens can experience agency in the public domain, and this experience of power can be influential for both increased civic engagement and for identity development including ethical stances for oneself and others (O'Donoghue and Strobel 2007).
P5: increasing interest in peace and moral education through community service and engagement (Noddings 2010,2012).{\&}quot;˜Peace education empowers learners with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values necessary to end violence and injustice and promote a culture of peace'(Teachers Without Borders 2013). There is diversity in program structures, objectives, and curricula (Galtung 2008). Salomon and Cairns (2010, 5) observed that competing visions of peace education strive{\&}quot;˜to negate violence and conflict and to promote a culture of peace to counter a culture of war.'Also common is the notion that peace education is{\&}quot;˜an important and necessary dimension of truly democratic and progressive societies'(Danesh 2006, 56). 
P5: {\&}quot;˜Youth activism represents a promising synthesis of two broad goals in moral education: the development of moral judgments about the social and political world and the ability to implement one's principles in action'(Kirshner 2005, 41). Providing social justice and community service programs is a social priority, particularly for youth living in conditions with few opportunities to develop a moral identity (Hart,Atkins, and Ford2010). 
P5: Respect for common causes is thought to be a function of experience and participation in the community through service activities (Youniss and Yates 1999). Over The life course, our relationship to the{\&}quot;˜herd changes{\&}quot;“tending towards increased
P6: civic involvement and prosocial action (Erikson 1959).
P8: youth that reported higher levels of program and service involvement also reported higher levels on the moral factor, 
P9: awareness of community and global issues opens up a space for them to encounter ethical dilemmas and reconsider previously held commitments.
P9: Larson (2000) noted that initiative can flourish in voluntary-structured activity in youth-serving settings
P10: youth understood their own growing sense of efficacy for community problem-solving was the result of a shared experience of service in the community.
P10: what they learned about themselves, and several reported feeling more caring, more confident, and more outgoing. Not everybody saw change however, and several replied with short phrases such as{\&}quot;˜not really anything,'or{\&}quot;˜I Don't really know.'There were several respondents that noted no change in self-processes, as they felt they already had a consolidated sense of self. 
P10: satisfaction in demonstrating (to themselves and others) a positive contribution (Eccles and Barber 1999). Individuals With a greater commitment to role identities have a stronger link between identity meanings and behavior (Burke and Reitzes 1991).
P11: helping others was a central characteristic of self-definition
P11: they benefited from an increased self-awareness
P11: they{\&}quot;˜learned how to help to take action that benefitted the community, and that they received positive feedback from social action that informs or reinforces who they are becoming (Stryker and Serpe 1982).
P11: care and a sense of obligation as motivating forces for self-reflection and increased participation.
P12: Meaning in life has been described as a protective factor in the lives of youth,and service participation may promote this psychosocial construct (Fry 1998).
P12: working in the community allowed them to have the experience as powerful social actors. 
P12: Working for community benefit that is at once personally meaningful can promote the development of youth purpose (Damon, Menon, and Bronk 2003), and can be facilitated by structured service activity.
P12: Social identity can be a powerful motivator of behavior, as group identifications connote certain cultural practices (Stets and Burke 2000). Social identity has been defined as self-representations that originate in group membership and can thought of in terms of a sense of connection and value for a group or organization (Finn {\&}amp; Rock 1997).
P12: a strong sense of connection to their local group, and identified several mechanisms that promote that sense of belongingness. They noted that having the same goals, sharing experience through service, and having a social space all contributed to group bonding. 
P13: Service activity creates a shared history{\&}quot;“a connection that along with other social bonding influences can promote sustained effort and participation.
P13: A sense of relatedness is an important affordance of the learning environment that can promote increased engagement (see Jones et al.2013), as well as identification with social settings and programs.
P13: shared a sense of pride and a satisfaction having made a difference through their individual and group efforts. Pride is a positive psychosocial experience, and can promote identification with social groups.
P13: The sense of accomplishment through personal and collective action can also lead to more intense identification with groups. A sense of competence in the social arena can be a new and exciting experience for emerging community actors, and serves as an incentive for increased engagement (Reeve, Deci, and Ryan2004).
P14: Social identification can be a positive psychosocial experience and also a power-ful motivator. 
P14: They link a sense of connection with value for the local groups and larger organization.
P14: Role identities become more numerous and complex in adolescence (Harter 1999).
P14: they described a process whereby youth devel-oped awareness and changed their behavior, resulting in increased engagement in PeaceJam and community service. This provided an opportunity for reflection and the reorganization of values, priorities, and identities. A persistent theme that pre-sented in analysis was the construct of social identity, and the influence of group bonds on personal experience and future orientations.
P17: connected involvement in PeaceJam with the development of compassion and leadership. He also drew the connection between a sense of empowerment and confidence in his abilities with the desire to pursue roles and responsibilities in the community. 
P17: Engagement awoke or engendered a calling to help{\&}quot;“and through this process they came to identify as influential social actors and caring individuals.
P18: Analyses revealed that participants valued service, found it personally meaningful, and planned on working for social causes in the future. 
P18: An increased awareness may force a reconsideration of personal values and identities. Community service encourages youth to assume role-specific identities, and allows youth to see themselves as powerful social actors. Youth may commit to moral identities when they perceive positive feedback and personal benefit from such identification (Turner 2013). Community engagement can promote the development of social or collective identity as youth demonstrate to themselves and others the kind of individual that they desire to become (Eccles 2009). The sense of accomplishment earned through community and social action can promote a sense of personal meaning and efficacy, and inform the construction of prosocial identities. Psychological perspectives have much to offer the field of peace education (Christie and Wagner 2010), and the construction of moral identities and commitments is an important developmental process for adolescents that can contribute to a culture of peace.},

abstract = {The inclusion of minorities in the civic affairs of society is critical. Research indicates many of today's youth are less likely to engage in meaningful civic activities and more likely to experience social exclusion because of disparities in educational settings, economic disadvantages, and health disparities. This phenomenon is more likely to occur in communities overcome by crime, drug dealing, and other indicators of diminished quality of life, where there is greater anonymity and suspicion among neighbors and less trust. Social trust is a significant trait for adulthood because social trust promotes individuals' actively engaging in society and seeing themselves as valued members of their communities. Secondary data from teh CIRCLE national youth survey, comprising 1000 youths between ages 15-25 years, show that youth who trust in others and trust in government are more likely to participate in community service, voting and political volunteerism, even among young minorities.},

abstract = {This study examined the association between adolescents' religious development. social integration, and risk-taking behaviors. Religious development was tracked along 4 trajectories from sophomore to senior year in high school: low religiosity (sophomore)-low religiosity (senior), low-high, high-low, and high-high. Civic integration was measured by participation in civic activities (e.g., working on a political campaign, demonstrating for a cause), participation in extracurricular activities, and willingness to perform volunteer service. Risk-taking behaviors included alcohol use and marijuana use. For the most part, civic integration was positively associated with the stable or upward religious developmental trajectories, whereas alcohol and drug use were associated with low and downward trajectories.},

Highlighted on Page 2: the salience of religion for high school seniors was positively related to their involvement in school activities, the kinds of peer groups with which they affiliated, and their likelihood of doing voluntary service.
Highlighted on Page 2: Our view is that adolescents who are religious tend to be involved in society-promoting activities for several reasons. One is that their religiousness exposes them to values regarding prosocial attitudes and behavior. Another is that prosocial values are espoused by adults and peers who share their religiousness. Still another is that religious institutions to which they might belong provide opportunities to be engaged in prosocial activities and, there-fore, lead to the development of a positive civic identity (e.g., Raskoff {\&}amp; Sundeen, 1999; Youniss {\&}amp; Yates,1997).
Highlighted on Page 3: As part of the identity formation process, youth looked beyond themselves to connect with the ideologies of enduring social institutions and structures as one source of meaning in their lives. Religion, with a historically rooted ideology, provides one possible system of values and meaning for youth.
Highlighted on Page 3: Numerous studies report that church attendance decreases through adolescence, whereas importance of religion or religious salience remains relatively stable (Gallup{\&}amp; Bezilla, 1992; King, Elder, {\&}amp; Whitbeck, 1997).
Highlighted on Page 3: Hoge and Petrillo (1978) found that parents have a strong influence on their children's church attendance but almost no influence on their children's attitudes to-ward the church. 
Highlighted on Page 3: youth participation in church-related activities such as religious education and youth groups is related to the types of relationships that adolescents have with clergy, youth ministers, and teachers.

Highlighted on Page 7: religious perspective scores were found to correlate inversely with use of alcohol and marijuana.
Highlighted on Page 7: one half of the group that had high scores on our religious perspective measure in Grades 10 and 12 did not identify themselves with any particular denomination.
Highlighted on Page 7: It is clear that an individual does not have to be formally identified with a particular de-nomination to be highly religious or spiritual, 
Highlighted on Page 7: Students in the high-high group,who started with and maintained a high religious perspective, showed strong proclivity for participating in extracurricular activities and civic engagement and were the least likely to engage in alcohol or marijuana use. This set of findings is interesting if only because they show that the avoidance of risk-taking is not so much driven by disengagement from the youth culture as by engagement in the more positive aspects of the youth culture and of the larger society, as exemplified by volunteer service and civic engagement. 
Highlighted on Page 7: The low-low group, on the other hand, was disengaged from school and community issues, showing little interest in extracurricular activities and civic intentions. 
Highlighted on Page 8: Martinson, Wilkening, and Buttel (1982)found that religious affiliation played a major role in integrating an individual into the community. Similarly, Funderburk (1986) found that religious beliefs in youth were positively associated with support for the political system, its laws, and symbols. These earlier findings lend some support for the consistently high level of civic engagement in the high-high group. Conversely, the low-low group, disengaged from extracurricular activities and volunteer service, is the only group that does not exhibit a significant increase in civic engagement over time.
Highlighted on Page 8: Volunteer Service Church affiliation provides opportunities for community involvement that may not be as readily avail-able to non affiliated youth (Youniss, McLellan, {\&}amp;Yates, 1999). Religious institutions have a long standing tradition of service to homeless, poor, sick, and older individuals. Furthermore, they provide a context in which service is based on shared religious principles that provide a transcendent meaning. Service often ex-poses youth to novel experiences, such as an encounter with a homeless person, a visit with an older patient in a hospital or nursing home, or a tutoring session with an underprivileged child. These experiences provide the context for transcendent reflection that help youth to examine their own lives and to understand how their experiences connect them with society (Youniss {\&}amp;Yates, 1997).
Highlighted on Page 8: The most striking finding was that marijuana use in the high-low group moved from the lowest level of usage in the sophomore year to the highest level of usage in the senior year. 
Highlighted on Page 8: there is evidence that religiously connected youth are less likely to engage in substance abuse(Donahue {\&}amp; Benson, 1995). 
Highlighted on Page 8: religion and spirituality play a significant role in the lives of adolescents. Religion provides a medium for integrating youth into church,civic, and extracurricular activities. Furthermore, it provides a network of positive relationships that ex-pose youth to prosocial attitudes and behaviors while discouraging risk-taking behaviors. For youth who are trying to make sense of a potentially disordered and confusing world, religion and spirituality provide one possible framework of meaning among others such as political philosophies, ethnic traditions, and cultural symbols. Religious youth are well-integrated members of their community. To ignore the influence of religion and spirituality in youth is to neglect a significant component of adolescent development.},

abstract = {Using recent advancements in the Capability Approach, we firstly characterize capabilities as fuzzy entities, and then propose a closed loop, where investments in human capital, capabilities and modes of economic production are combined. We argue that, given the complex relations between human capital accumulation and capability enlargements, educational policies have to be designed to include their direct and indirect effects on human development. In doing this, the United Nations Development Program's capacity development principles can be a useful reference point. These principles are consistent with the Capability Approach view of education as an empowerment process, in which not only job-oriented, but also life-oriented skills are provided. Moreover, the capacity development principles suggest how to organize educational policies operatively in order to give people crucial capabilities. Finally, we argue that network organizations are possible environments in which educational policies can be implemented.},

abstract = {This article analyzes the development of initiative as an exemplar of one of many learning experiences that should be studied as part of positive youth development. The capacity for initiative is essential for adults in our society and will become more important in the 21st century, yet adolescents have few opportunities to learn it. Their typical experiences during schoolwork and unstructured leisure do not reflect conditions for learning initiative. The context best suited to the development of initiative appears to be that of structured voluntary activities, such as sports, arts, and participation in organizations, in which youths experience the rare combination of intrinsic motivation in combination with deep attention. An incomplete body of outcome research suggests that such activities are associated with positive development, but the developmental processes involved are only beginning to be understood. One promising approach has recorded language use and has found that adolescents participating in effective organizations acquire a new operating language that appears to correspond to the development of initiative.},

Highlighted on Page 1: The con- struct initiative is closely related to capacity for agency or for autonomous action that others have discussed (Brandt- st{\~{}}idter, 1998; Deci, 1995; Ryan, 1993). It consists of the ability to be motivated from within to direct attention and effort toward a challenging goal. 
Highlighted on Page 3: initiative involves intrinsic motivation, the experience of wanting to be doing an activity and being invested in it. Agency entails the experience that one's thoughts and actions originate voluntarily from the self (Ryan, 1993; Ryan, Sheldon, Kasser, {\&}amp; Deci, 1996). 
Highlighted on Page 6: Rogoff et al. also emphasized that this process of learning was collabora- tive-with parents, peers, and customers--and they pro- vided a useful warning that development of initiative is not necessarily an individual process, but rather often involves this type of collaborative agency.
Highlighted on Page 4: the great majority of adolescents' time is spent in two opposite experiential situations. In school- work, they experience concentration and challenge without being intrinsically motivated. In most leisure, including
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; watching TV and interacting with friends, they experience intrinsic motivation but not in a context of concentration and challenge. Neither provides the combination of both of these elements necessary for the experience and develop- ment of initiative. There is, however, one small segment of adolescents' time that combines intrinsic motivation and concerted attention. Structured Voluntary Activities This one exception is a category we call structured volun- tary activities, or youth activities for short. It includes activities that are organized by adults, such as extracurric- ular school activities and community youth activities, as well as structured activities that youth participate in on their own--such diverse things as hobbies, writing poetry, constructing a web site, or playing in a band with a group of friends. Our defining criteria for this category is activi- ties that are voluntary (i.e., not required for school) and involve some structure {\&}quot;:
Significant portions of an adolescents waking life is spent studying, spending time with friends and watching television - none of which provide opportunities for initiative. Voluntary activities are the exception though.
Highlighted on Page 9: the development of agency in these contexts often involves collective participation.
Highlighted on Page 9: New participants appeared to undergo a paradigm shift in their way of thinking, reflecting qualitative developmental change. They ap- peared to have developed skills for implementing plans, for directing and regulating their activities over time. They ingested a new mode of action. Along with it, they reported feeling more self-efficacious, more confident in their ability to affect the world (Heath, 1997). Such a paradigm shift could provide an explanation of why youth in adventure programs show sustained and increased effects after the program is over; they acquire an operating language that is generative.
Highlighted on Page 9: intrinsic motivation and concen- tration that is rarely present during their daily experiences in schoolwork and unstructured leisure. These two compo- nents of experience, I proposed, represent two critical ele- ments of initiative, and when they occur in activities in- volving a temporal arc of action toward a goal, as is the case with many youth activities, all three elements for the experience and learning of initiative are in play.},

The results showed that participants whose purpose in life had different levels also had varied prosocial beliefs about volunteerism, volunteering intention, and volunteering behavior. Purpose in life was associated more strongly with prosocial value function than with other types of beliefs (except understanding function). When different beliefs are grouped, the correlation between purpose in life and other-serving beliefs was higher than that between purpose in life and self-serving beliefs. Purpose in life was also associated with volunteering intention and behavior. Path analyses showed that purpose in life predicted volunteering behavior via beliefs and intention. While other-serving beliefs predicted volunteering behavior directly, self-serving beliefs did not have such direct effect.},

abstract = {Using the tripartite conception of positive youth development (PYD) suggested by Hamilton (1999) – as a developmental process, a philosophy or approach to youth programming, and as instances of youth programs and organizations focused on fostering the healthy or positive development of youth – we review different theoretical models of the developmental process involved in PYD. In addition, we review the ideas for and the features of youth development programs aimed at promoting PYD. We discuss the need for research interrelating different, theoretically-predicated measures of PYD and, as well, the importance of clear links between models of the PYD developmental process and of the youth development programs seeking to enhance PYD among diverse youth. We discuss several conceptual and practical problematics that must be addressed in order to integrate the three facets of PYD scholarship.},
annote = {Highlighted on Page 45: Reed Larson and the Study of Motivation, Active Engagement, and Real-Life Challenges. For Larson (2006), PYD is “a process in which young people’s capacity for being motivated by challenge energizes their active engagement in development” (p. 677). For positive development to occur, the motivational system must become activated and remain engaged in multiple domains of development while young people deal with everyday real life challenges. Larson characterizes a young person’s initiativeas both a key component of PYD and, as well, an important focal point for youth development programs seeking to promote PYD (Larson, 2000). Defining initiative as “the capacity to direct cumulative effort over time toward achievement of a long term goal” (Larson, Hansen, {\&}amp; Walker, 2005, p. 160), Larson (2000) posits that initiative is a central requirement for “components of PYD, such as creativity, leadership, altruism, and civic engagement” (p. 170).  
Highlighted on Page 45: Much of Eccles’ work examines the roles of motivational beliefs, values, and goals on an adolescent’s positive development. In order to study these factors, Eccles and colleagues tested an expectancy-value model of achievement-related choices (e.g., Eccles, 2004). This model holds that an individual’s activity choice, persistence, and performance are related to his or her expectations of success and value for the activity which, in turn, are also influenced by a variety of other personal and contextual factors (Eccles {\&}amp; Wigfield, 2002).

With his focus on agency and initiative, much of the recent work by Larson and colleagues focuses on how youth development programs can best develop these and related skills in participating youth (e.g., Dawes {\&}amp; Larson, 2011). Larson has suggested that across diverse programs, an important component for the development of initiative may be the concurrent development of personal connections with adult leaders or other participating peers. 
Highlighted on Page 46: Out-of-school-time (OST) activities are key program contexts Larson has considered in depth. OST programs with structured activities are seen as contexts in which youth can act as producers of their own positive development (Eccles {\&}amp; Gootman, 2002); such programs offer opportunities to develop skills and competencies necessary for negotiating the real world (Mahoney, Vandell, Simkins, {\&}amp; Zarrett, 2009). These skills and competencies include taking initiative, developing leadership, and learning responsibility, as well as strategic and teamwork skills (e.g., Larson, 2000; Larson, Walker, {\&}amp; Pearce, 2005). At the same time, participation in structured OST activities may be associated with negative experiences such as stress, inappropriate adult behavior, negative influences, social exclusion, and negative group dynamics. Accordingly, Larson seeks to specify the approach that needs to be taken in community-based, OST programs in order to promote PYD.

We affirm the essential homogeneity between these two forms of social action and their antecedents. The study has a twofold aim: 1) testing the identified antecedents on the volunteer participants by means of discriminant analysis, and 2) testing the same variables on youth engaged in politics. Participants were 706 young people - engaged and not engaged - distributed throughout Italy - aged 19-29 (M=22.36, SD=1.10). The instrument used was a self-report questionnaire. The findings reveal that several variables discriminate between engaged and not engaged youth. They also show the presence of several areas of overlap between variables considered in the engaged groups (political and voluntary action).},

P1: antecedents of social action (Snyder {\&}amp; Omoto, 2007)
P1: during their youth that individuals learn societal values and form civic and social identities as citizens of today and tomorrow renders the study of social action during this period of life interesting and important(Youniss {\&}amp; Yates,1997)
P1: What is social action? The most complete definition is that of Snyder {\&}amp; Omoto (2007), who mean by this expression all the activities in which people act in ways that will benefit not only themselves as individuals, but also the larger communities of which they are members.
P2: different forms of social action? In our opinion, this categorization is possible thanks to the crossing of two variables that organize its meaning: the structuring and duration of the commitment itself. The first refers to the organizational and institutional presence within the action itself and envisages the possibility that actions are carried out in a define place, characterized by values, rulesandways functioning.The second refers to temporal investment in the action and can thus vary from a few minutes to a weekly, or in some cases, a daily commitment.
P3: Kelly (2009), in a recent article, focused on trust processes, finding a predictive power for trust with respect to youth participation and linking it to a more general construct of social well-being.
P3:  a cognitively rich and emotionally supportive family environment nourishes the development of a whole series of social and academic abilities (McLoyd,1998). 
P4: this probability becomes higher when young people receive an invitation to participate in these activities directly from friends, relatives or significant people (Marta {\&}amp; Scabini, 2003).
P4: The probability of engaging in the community is decidedly greater for youth who have had experiences of participation in youth clubs or groups from a young age.
P8: Sense of community clearly distinguishes between engaged and not engage
P9: sense of community and experiences of extracurricular activities in adolescence and childhood carry more weight among volunteers, and self-determination and engagement values carry more weight among the politically active.
P9: The Findings demonstrate that social trust, prosocial personality and religiosity, which in the volunteer vs. control subgroup make a good contribution to the discriminant function, do not give significant results in the group of politically engaged vs. not engaged. The results regarding social trust runs against the grain of what we find in literature, in which there is substantial empirical evidence that sees social trust as being bound up with social action and civic behaviors (Kelly, 2009).
MY THOUGHTS: I wonder if this links to the research showing females with a positive view of the future are more likely to be engaged whilst males with a negative 
view of their future are more likely.
P9: As regards prosocial personality, its missing significance can probably be connected to the specific personality characteristics that identify the politically active youth. Prosocial personality, in fact, refers to constructs such as empathy, moral reasoning and social responsibility, considered to be at the basis of the relation with the Other And, therefore, very close to the characteristics that distinguish an engaged volunteer in a helping relationship. It can be hypothesized that other elements are at play in politically active youth: for example, the sense of self-efficacy, empowerment and civic sense.},

The current study proposed a modified conceptual model among the constructs (parent and peer influences, prosocial personality dimensions, and sociodemographic correlates) outlined in Penner's (2002) model of volunteering. Participants were 542 adolescent volunteers (57{\%} female, M age = 16.47 years, SD = 68) in Magen David Adom, a first-aid organization located in Israel. Structural equation modeling was used to examine indirect and moderating influences on two volunteering outcomes: extent of and intention to sustain volunteering. Supporting the proposed model, a significant indirect path between parental influences, sympathy, helpfulness, and volunteering was evident for both outcomes. Demographic characteristics (sex, age, and secular orientation) did not moderate these relations, although being male and older were significantly related to increased volunteering. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Although an increasing number of schools mandate service, this requirement is seen by some as self-contradictory, especially in contrast to voluntary service. Looking closely at the service process, we argue that the categories of required and voluntary, do not in themselves convey the nature of service students might do with implications for the benefits they may derive from service. We report data from students in 2 high schools to support our case. Both schools required service, but one integrated it into the curriculum whereas the other left choice of service to individual students. Students in the former school were more apt to do the kinds of service that engage students cognitively and emotionally and involve them in reflection on politics and morals. Apart from fulfilling their requirement, many of the students also did volunteer service of the kinds that were potentially beneficial. These students were likely to have parents and best friends who also did service and to belong to churches and civic organizations that sponsored or encouraged service as part of an ideological commitment. The data support the idea that required and volunteer service can be usefully viewed as operating according to separate regimens. Nevertheless, both have the potential for yielding benefits when service is viewed as providing youth with opportunities to learn about systems of meaning through participatory action. From the viewpoint of educational policy, schools can help students most when they organize service strategically and integrate service into the academic curriculum.},

abstract = {Despite recent figures indicating that 26{\%} of public high schools in the United States require student involvement in community service or service learning, there is little empirical evidence to support such policies. In the present study, successive cohorts of high school students, one without (n = 174) and two with a community service requirement (n = 312), were compared longitudinally on measures of civic attitudes and behaviors. Each cohort was divided according to individual students' inclinations to serve voluntarily. Students already inclined to serve scored high on all measures throughout and showed no advantage after meeting the requirement. However, students who were less inclined to serve showed marked gains on three of four civic measures after completing their requirement. Whereas they scored as low as their less-inclined counterparts who had no requirement during grade 11, they differed from their counterparts after serving the mandated 40 hours during grade 12. This quasi-natural experiment provides support for the argument that a well-designed service program can have a clear benefit in civic development for nonself-selected youth.},

For these students, the 40 hours of service that theschool required fit their predisposition toward civic involvement; they enteredtheir junior year highly involved and remained involved through the end of theirsenior year. They started the study with experience in volunteer service, com-pleted the 40-hour requirement by their junior year, and continued to do volun-teer service thereafter (Metz {\&}amp; Youniss, 2003). Thus, it would not be possible todiscern precisely what contribution the requirement made apart from reinforcing
Highlighted on Page 20: their ongoing civic orientation. By all appearances these students were on a devel-opmental path toward civic involvement for which the school requirement wascomplementary, but not decisive in itself.The picture for the less-inclined students is quite different. They came toschool with backgrounds that were not so rich in the kinds of resources thatpromote civic involvement. Among other things, they and their parents had rela-tively restricted experience in voluntary service which may indicate a tepid homeorientation toward civic involvement. And it was likely their parents were rela-tively distanced from active religious membership. Thus, at the start of the junioryear, the less-inclined students scored relatively low on all of our civic indicators as would be expected from the Verba et al. (1995) model. In keeping with lackof resources and minimal service experience, these students scored lowest on theengagement measures.These low scores were maintained throughout the junior year in both the 2000and 2001/2002 cohorts. It is significant, then, that these groups became differen-tiated at the end of the senior year, after the 2001/2002 cohort had completed the40-hour requirement. The experience of service was associated with increases onthree of the four civic indicators and, according to regression analyses, was a con-tributor to the differentiation between the two groups, even when junior-yearscores on the measures were taken into account. These results apply in reverse tothe self-selection critique. If students who scored high on the dependent measureswere already civically oriented, then the less-inclined-to-serve students wereselective in the opposite direction. Hence, their increases on the civic measuresfrom the end of junior to the end of senior year are reasonably attributed, not toindividual proclivities, but to having experienced the 40-hour requirement, allother things being equal for the 2000 and 2001/2002 classes.},

Finding ways to instill hope could therefore be seen as vital. However, is hope positively related to engagement or is it only a sign of illusory optimism? The aim of the study was to explore if hope concerning climate change has a significant relation to pro-environmental behavior as well as an impact on behavior when controlling for already well-known predictors such as values, social influence, knowledge, and gender. Two questionnaire studies were performed, one with a group of Swedish teenagers (n =723) and one with a group of Swedish young adults (n= 381). ‘Constructive’ hope had a unique positive influence on pro-environ- mental behavior. Hope based on denial, however, was negatively correlated with pro-environmental behavior in the two samples and was a significant neg- ative predictor in the teenage group. The conclusion is that hope is not only a pleasant feeling but could also work as a motivational force, if one controls for denial. Implications for education concerning sustainable development are discussed.},

Highlighted on Page 2: 'Constructive' hope had a unique positive influence on pro-environmental behavior. Hope based on denial, however, was negatively correlated with pro-environmental behavior in the two samples and was a significant negative predictor in the teenage group. The conclusion is that hope is not only a pleasant feeling but could also work as a motivational force, if one controls for denial. 
Highlighted on Page 2: Because young people are those most likely to suffer the negative consequences of climate change,and since they are the future leaders of society, one could argue that this group is especially important to include in societal deliberations about this issue.
Highlighted on Page 2: Unfortunately, studies have found that although many young people show an interest in global problems, feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, and helplessness, as well as inactivity are common (Bentley, Fien, and Neil 2004; Connell et al. 1999; Eckersley 1999; Fleer 2002; Hicks 1996, 2001; Tucci, Mitchell, and Goddard 2007).
Highlighted on Page 2: For example, an Australian study found that among a group of 10-14-year-olds about 27{\%} believed that the world may end during their lifetime due to climate change and
Highlighted on Page 3: other global threats (Tucci, Mitchell, and Goddard 2007). In addition, a German study showed that although young people are optimistic about their own future, two-thirds think climate change threatens human existence (Albert, Hurrelmann, and Quenzel 2010). Pessimism seems to be particularly strong when it comes to environmental problems (Hicks and Holden 2007) and research has shown that education about global issues sometimes increases these negative feelings (Hicks and Bord 2001).Finding ways to instill hope could therefore be seen as vital.
Highlighted on Page 3: Few empirical studies have explored how hope relates to engagement concern-ing global environmental problems. This is regrettable because it is not certain thatall sources of hope have a positive effect on engagement since hope could also bebased on denial (for reviews, see McGeer 2004; Snyder et al. 2002).
Highlighted on Page 4: The hope concept is obviously complex; including for instance emotional, cognitive, existential, identity-related and social aspects. One way to make this concept manageable for scientific investigation is presented in the most well-known psychological theory about hope developed by Snyder (2000) and Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon (2001). This theory proposes that hope consists of three different components: goals “that which we want to happen; pathway thinking “an ability to come up with routes to get to where we want; and agency thinking “the motivation to use these pathways. Thus, hope arises when a positive goal is felt as being within reach(Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon 2001). Hope concerns ideas of the future and therefore includes strong cognitive dimensions, but it is also emotional. Hope is imbued with a positive feeling about the future; it is a kind of a conviction about the unproven(McGeer 2004)
Highlighted on Page 4: n health psychology, researchers in empirical studies have found that people with high levels of hope take in more information about how to protect themselves from illnesses, and use this information in a more active way than those low on hope (Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon2001). They have a capacity for constructive thinking about how to deal with the problems (Drach-Zahavy and Somech 2002). People feeling a high degree of hope take action, and have the ability to figure out ways to reach their desired goals(Snyder 2000). The emotional character of the hope concept is a strong motivational force which gives energy to act even in the absence of certainties (Courville and Piper 2004; McGeer 2004). Hence, does hope perhaps also motivate social engagement?
Highlighted on Page 4: study found that hope “measured in a simple way by asking subjects to rate how much hope they felt about the environmental problems “had no relation to behavior. However, an interaction effect between worry and hope was identified, showing that for individuals highly worried about the global environmental problems, hope was positively related to behavior, while for individuals feeling a low degree of worry,hope was negatively related to behavior. Thus, hope combined with a low degree of worry seemed to make the young adults reluctant to behave in a pro-environmental fashion, perhaps because they denied the problems.
Highlighted on Page 5: In accordance with Snyder's hope theory (Snyder 2000; Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon 2001), the sources of hope that the young people in these two studies mentioned were perceived as abilities to come up with alternative pathways to reach desired goals, in this case,a future less burdened by global environmental problems.Three main hope themes were identified (see Ojala 2007b, 105-7). The first theme was called positive reappraisal. 4 Here, the young persons, after describing their worries about the environmental problems, thought about them in a different way so to also activate hope. 
Highlighted on Page 5: The second hope theme concerned trust in sources outside oneself. This covered, for instance, trust in technology and trust in environmental organizations. This result is in accordance with a study by Fleer (2002) showing that it is quite common among young people to put their trust in technological solutions of environmental problems. However, the question of whether this trust is actually beneficial for environmental engagement, or is instead used to escape personal responsibility,has not been investigated. Finally, the third hope theme concerned trust in one's own ability to influence environmental problems in a positive direction. 
Highlighted on Page 5: researchers have argued that it is vital to teach young people action competence in order to encourage empowerment and avoid cynicism (for a review, see Bentley, Fien, and Neil 2004).
Highlighted on Page 10: Hope based on denial had a negative relation to behavior while all the other factors were, as expected, positively correlated with pro-environmental behavior. That is, the more constructive hope, biospheric values and so on the young people possess, the more likely it is that they will behave environmentally friendly,while the opposite is true for hope based on denial. 
Highlighted on Page 10: girls were more likely to behave pro-environmentally than boys. However, this gender effect disappeared almost entirely when the other factors were included in the model.
Highlighted on Page 13: it is important to distinguish between hope based on denial of climate change and hope based on more constructive forms of coping with this threat. When hope is based on denial it is not a positive phenomenon from the point of view of engagement, quite the contrary. Nevertheless,the study clearly shows that to automatically judge positive emotions, such as hope,as delusional and trivial, and as hindering people from taking climate change seriously is simply not correct.
Highlighted on Page 13: Positive re-appraisal is also beneficial when it comes to coping with climate change, promoting an active stance toward the problems.
Highlighted on Page 13: in the context of climate change, but also when it comes to other societal problems, it is important to extend the individualistic focus of Snyder's hope theory (Snyder 2000; Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon 2001) to also include collective dimensions (Courville and Piper 2004; McGeer 2004). 
Highlighted on Page 14: young people often experience a high degree of helplessness or even hopelessness when it comes to global problems such as climate change. Many young people seem to lack 'good story' about the global future and are instead trapped in a discourse of threat and gloom (Reid, Payne, and Cutter-Mackenzie 2010). Education about sustainable development could be seen as a collective process where teachers and pupils/students together create a story about the future. What the present study indicates is that in this process concentrating on hope is one important aspect. This is not only in order to make young people feel good, but also to help them use their knowledge in a constructive manner and take an active stance concerning climate change.
Highlighted on Page 14: Snyder's (2000) hope theory it here becomes vital to identify optimistic but still realistic sub-goals concerning one's own engagement, and to identify and discuss pathways, i.e. different individual and collective pro-environmental behaviors that are effective in trying to reach the sub-goals. It is also important to encourage a feeling of agency “that everyone's effort is worth something “and to help the young to take satisfaction in small successes. When people start to do something concrete it seems as if hope is evoked by the actions themselves. Hope, in a sense, becomes embodied.
Highlighted on Page 15: However, since the climate threat will not be solved directly just because a small group of people do something, to not only encourage critical thinking but also positive thinking, such as positive re-appraisal, could create a feeling of hope that can help the young to maintain their engagement. This process can be started by discussing young people's view of the global future. If it is very pessimistic, are there different ways of looking at it? Are there any positive trends to focus on? How has humanity solved large and seemingly uncontrollable problems historically? In moving beyond the popular media's apocalyptic images,one can also encourage young people to search for alternative stories about the future in, for instance, art and literature, stories that could be used as a base for critical and creative discussions (see Reid, Payne, and Cutter-Mackenzie 2010).
Highlighted on Page 15: one also needs to encourage young people to see positive aspects that can activate hope, a feeling that can transform worry into a constructive motivational force (see Ojala 2007b). Thus, hope about climate change is more than an illusion or a solace; it could also be an important path to engagement.},

abstract = {The question of how youth become engaged or motivated is vital to youth development programs, because engagement influences not only program retention but the likelihood of youth gaining the benefits that programs offer. This article reports on an in-depth study aimed at generating grounded theory about the change process through which youth who are initially disengaged become motivated by program activities. Youth in a civic activism program were interviewed over a 4-month period and qualitative analyses were used to derive a model of this change process. This process was found to proceed from the youth forming a personal connection to the program's mission to becoming intrinsically motivated by work on program activities. The analyses suggested that peers and the adult leader played important roles in supporting motivational change at each stage. The model developed from the investigation draws on existing theories of motivation.},
annote = {Along the path of engagement, motivational change is supported by both peers and the programs facilitator (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p121).
It has been shown that psychologically engaged youth gain more knowledge and understanding from programs (Gottfried,Fleming, {\&}amp; Gottfried, 1998; Guay, Boggiano, {\&}amp; Vallerand, 2001; Lepper, Sethi, Dialdin {\&}amp; Drake,1997; Ryan {\&}amp; Deci, 2000 FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p121).
Limited programs are able to engage youth effectively (Ngai {\&}amp; Cheung, 1997; Vandell et al., 2005) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p121), resulting in low retention rates (Anderson-Butcher, 2005; Weiss, Little, {\&}amp; Bouffard,2005) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p121) and limiting the benefits of such programs (Mahoney, Lord, {\&}amp; Carrl, in press) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p121)
A number of school districts in the United States have made service learning a mandatory requirement, and concern has been expressed about this mandate limiting both the intrinsic motivation and consequently the benefits derived (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p122). But experience with the Pathways to Education program suggest that making certain aspects mandatory is the motivation some youth may initially need. Caroline Acker, talking about her experiences in the developing the program says: {\&}quot;The kids actually told us to make tutoring mandatory. After our first year, which we called a pilot year, we brought in the youth, we did focus groups with the tutors and mentors, [asking] how do we improve this, and we asked the young people {\&}quot;how do we increase attendance at tutoring{\&}quot; and the naughtiest boys of all looked at us and said {\&}quot;you have to make it mandatory{\&}quot;. So the young people want structure, and they want to know that somebody is caring about them.{\&}quot; (Caroline Acker, quoted on Dubner 2014, How to fix a Broken High Schooler, in Four Easy Steps: A New Freakonomics Radio Podcast, http://freakonomics.com/ 2014/12/04/how-to-fix-a-broken-high-schooler-in-four-easy-steps-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/
For participation to be sustainable, service needs to internatlise social responsibilty, become habitual (Yates {\&}amp; Youniss, 1996; Youniss {\&}amp; Yates, 1997) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p122) and the program need to tap into the youth’s ideals (Sherman, 2002) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p122).
Motivation, according to self-determination theory, can be conceptualised as a continuum, from amotivation to extrinsic, to intrinsic motivation (Ryan and Deci's(2000, 2003) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p122).
When an individual enjoys the activity itself, sustained participation is a natural outcome (as also described by Csikszentmihalyi, 1975, 1990) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p123).
When meaning is created and the service becomes personally relevant, interest and engagement is increased (Hidi, 2000; Hidi {\&}amp; Harackiewicz, 2000) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p123).
Service becomes personally meaningful and relevant when the individual deepens their understanding of the issues involved, gains feelings of empowerment and develops a sense of value around the program (Hidi, 2000; Mitchell, 1993) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p123).
Environments which are empowering and autonomous, ones that provide challenging and achievable goals, are more likely to engage an individual's intrinsic motivation (Mitchell, 1993;Ryan {\&}amp; Deci, 2003) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p123).
Connections with others in the program - peers, facilitators and staff - is also important in the development of intrinsic motivation (Lewis-Charp et al., 2005; Pancer {\&}amp; Pratt, 1999) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p123), which is naturally accompanied by a sense of belonging, support and interpersonal connection (Ryan and Deci 2000) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p123).
Further involvement is also encouraged by a welcoming environment created by both facilitators and peers (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p128).
The creation of personal connections by youth towards a program and its initiatives, triggers their interests and spurs on engagement (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p128).
When personal connections to the cause had been established, the undertakings themselves became more enjoyable, and hence encouraged the development of intrinsic motivation (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p128). Research suggests that the autonomy and challenge of the experience, as well as relating to others, allows individuals to enjoy the work itself(Ryan and Deci 2000) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p128), while the building of knowledge, competence and positive experiences adds to the experience (Hidi, 2000; Hidi {\&}amp; Harackiewicz,2000) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p128).
Many theories suggest when an individual’s skills are appropriately challenged and a skill is mastered, particularly when they identify with those challenges, the individual’s are intrinsically motivated. (Csikszentmihalyi's (1975, 1990) (Csikszentmihalyi {\&}amp; Larson, 1984) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p129).
The collective meaning gained by working together on a particular cause developed practical skills and created personal meaning (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p129).
The combination of skills development and the creation of meaning, according to Csikszentmihalyi's theory, built intrinsic motivation and impelled them to desire further personal development (Csikszentmihalyi {\&}amp; Larson, 1984) FYISEE (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p129).
Collective efficacy was also developed through the collective engagement in such initiatives (Pearce {\&}amp; Larson 2006, p129).},

We present research at each level and discuss similarities and differences across levels.

The review provides a context for current contributions to the special issue of Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience on Adolescence, and highlights three important themes that emerge from the special issue, which are relevant to future research. First, the age of participants studied (and labels for these age groups) is a critical design consideration. We suggest that it might be logical to reduce the reliance on convenience samples of undergraduates to represent adults in psychology and cognitive neuroscience studies, since there is substantial evidence that the brain is still developing within this age range. Second, developmental researchers are broadening their scope of inquiry by testing for non-linear effects, via increased use of longitudinal strategies or much wider age ranges and larger samples. Third, there is increasing appreciation for the interrelatedness of the three areas of focus in this special issue (emotion reactivity and regulation, mentalizing, and peer relations), as well as with other areas of interest in adolescent development.},

Not surprisingly, out-of-school programs designed to capture the interest of early teens are diverse in focus and varied in structure, ranging from sports teams to drop-in recreation centers, from museum apprenticeships to mentoring relationships between an individual teen and an adult. This article describes the array of various organizations that offer programs and services for youths in their early teens. It explains the philosophy of positive youth development that has emerged as a unifying theme in this long-standing but newly self-conscious field. Principles of best practice are reviewed, as are five key implementation challenges: increasing participation by youths; expanding access to programs, especially in low-income communities; improving funding; evaluating program effectiveness; and coordination with other youth services. The article closes with a discussion anticipating the new opportunities that accompany the attention and funding now going toward positive youth development programs that enrich the lives of young people through informal learning.},

A Theory of Justice Quotes (showing 1-11 of 11)
“Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust. Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many. Therefore in a just society the liberties of equal citizenship are taken as settled; the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests.”

“Historically one of the main defects of constitutional government has been the failure to insure the fair value of political liberty. The necessary corrective steps have not been taken, indeed, they never seem to have been seriously entertained. Disparities in the distribution of property and wealth that far exceed what is compatible with political equality have generally been tolerated by the legal system. Public resources have not been devoted to maintaining the institutions required for the fair value of political liberty. Essentially the fault lies in the fact that the democratic political process is at best regulated rivalry; it does not even in theory have the desirable properties that price theory ascribes to truly competitive markets. Moreover, the effects of injustices in the political system are much more grave and long lasting than market imperfections. Political power rapidly accumulates and becomes unequal; and making use of the coercive apparatus of the state and its law, those who gain the advantage can often assure themselves of a favored position. Thus inequities in the economic and social system may soon undermine whatever political equality might have existed under fortunate historical conditions. Universal suffrage is an insufficient counterpoise; for when parties and elections are financed not by public funds but by private contributions, the political forum is so constrained by the wishes of the dominant interests that the basic measures needed to establish just constitutional rule are seldom properly presented. These questions, however, belong to political sociology. 116 I mention them here as a way of emphasizing that our discussion is part of the theory of justice and must not be mistaken for a theory of the political system. We are in the way of describing an ideal arrangement, comparison with which defines a standard for judging actual institutions, and indicates what must be maintained to justify departures from it.”

“Perhaps the most obvious political inequality is the violation of the precept one person one vote. Yet until recent times most writers rejected equal universal suffrage. Indeed, persons were not regarded as the proper subjects of representation at all. Often it was interests that were to be represented, with Whig and Tory differing as to whether the interest of the rising middle class should be given a place alongside the landed and ecclesiastical interests. For others it is regions that are to be represented, or forms of culture, as when one speaks of the representation of the agricultural and urban elements of society. At the first sight, these kinds of representation appear unjust. How far they depart from the precept one person one vote is a measure of their abstract injustice, and indicates the strength of the countervailing reasons that must be forthcoming.119”

A longitudinal data set of high school students (N = 603) was analyzed to investigate the developmental steps from types of service through intended civic behavior. Results showed that service involving direct interaction with people in need led students to judge that they had made contributions to sponsoring organizations and, consequently, altered their self-awareness. In turn, changed awareness enhanced reports of helping behavior toward strangers, which then led to the likelihood of future volunteering and of voting, working on a political campaign, and demonstrating for a cause. Additional causal analyses supported the directional sequence that began with service experiences, led to prosocial behavior, and eventuated in intended future civic involvement.},

The methodology of public scrutiny draws on Rawlsian understanding of ‘objectivity’ in ethics, but the impartiality that is needed cannot be confined within the borders of a nation. Public reasoning without territorial confinement is important for both.

Highlighted on Page 2: The concepts of human rights and human capabilities have something of a common motivation, but they differ in many distinct ways. I
Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; It is possible to argue that human rights are best seen as rights to certain specific freedoms, and that the correlate obligation to consider the associated duties must also be centred around what others can do to safeguard and expand these freedoms. Since capabilities can be seen,broadly, as freedoms of particular kinds, this would seem to establish a basic connection between the two categories of ideas. {\&}quot;:
Capabilities are the range of possible freedoms available to a particular person, while human rights are rights to specific freedoms (p152).
Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; ‘opportunity’ and ‘process’ are two aspects of freedom that require distinction, with the importance of each deserving specific acknowledgement.1 While the opportunity aspect of freedoms would seem to belong to the same kind of territory as capabilities, it is not at all clear that the same can be said about the process aspect of freedom {\&}quot;:
Whether or not someone has the opportunity to do something, does not take into account why someone would do it. For example, if someone is forced to do it, or does it by choice, are different processes irrespective of the resultant opportunity (p152).
Highlighted on Page 3: seeing opportunity in terms of capability allows us to distinguish appropriately between (i) whether a person is actually able to do things she would value doing, and (ii)whether she possesses the means or instruments or permissions to pursue what she would like to do (her actual ability to do that pursuing may depend on many contingent circumstances). 
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Differences in the capability to function can arise even with the same set of personal means(such as primary goods) for a variety of reasons, such as: (1)physical or mental heterogeneities among persons(related, for example, to disability,or proneness to illness); (2)variations in non-personal resources(such as the nature of public health care, or societal cohesion and the helpfulness of the community); (3)environmental diversities(such as climatic conditions, or varying threats from epidemic diseases or from local crime); or (4)different relative positions vis-a`-vis others {\&}quot;:
Capabilities can be effected by individual differences in relation to others, environmental diversity, physical or mental variances, or differences in societal resources (p154).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the freedom to have any particular thing can be substantially distinguished from actually having that thing. {\&}quot;:
Capabilities revolve around the individuals ability to choose, or not choose a particular thing - acknowledging that one might choose to not partake of that thing even if it is arguably best for them (p155).
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; has to be alive {\&}quot;:
MY QUESTION - does this imply being alive in the sense that it grows, develops and changes as a result of learning, consultation and experience?
Comment on Page 10, on highlighted text {\&}quot; To insist on a ‘fixed forever’ list of capabilities would deny the possibility of progress in social understanding, and also go against the productive role of public discussion, social agitation, and open debates. I have nothing against the listing of capabilities (and take part in that activity often enough), but I have to stand up against any proposal of a grand mausoleum to one fixed and final list of capabilities. {\&}quot;:
Creating a list of capabilities that is fixed and complete, suitable for all requirements, is a not useful or necessary. With the multiplicity of circumstance in existence, the hierarchy, and application of such a list would be unfeasible. Instead, one might put their energy into creating such lists for particular circumstances, or purposes, and be in tune with public discourse (pp157-60).
Comment on Page 11, on highlighted text {\&}quot; politically and socially repressive regimes, which do not allow open public discussion, many of these human rights are not taken seriously at all. {\&}quot;:
The need for public scrutiny and public discussion exists irrespective of certain countries ability to reject the subsequent human rights (pp160-1).
Highlighted on Page 10: the case for human rights cannot be discarded simply by pointing to the possibility that in
Comment on Page 11, on highlighted text {\&}quot; It is, however, important not to keep the domain of public reasoning confined to a given society only, especially in the case of human rights, in view of the inescapably universalist nature of these rights. {\&}quot;:
Human rights discourse should not be limited to nation specific justice, as the contribution made by those detached from local affairs can bring a broader range of counter arguments (p161).},

Comment on Page 1, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the central idea of human rights as something that people have, and have even without any specific legislation, is seen by many as foundationally dubious and lacking in cogency. A recurrent question is, Where do these rights come from? It is not usually disputed that the invoking of human rights can be politically powerful. Rather, the worries relate to what is taken to be the “softness” (some would say “mushiness”) of the conceptual grounding of human rights. {\&}quot;:
Questions of origins and cogency around human rights continue to pervade social discourse (p315).
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The invoking of human rights tends to come mostly from those who are concerned with changing the world rather than interpreting it {\&}quot;:
Human rights are often invoked, not by those interpreting the world, but by those attempting to change it (p317).
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; This pro-active stance has had its practical rewards, since it has allowed immediate use of the colossal appeal of the idea of human rights to confront intense oppression or great misery, without having to wait for the theoretical air to clear. {\&}quot;:
Those attempting to change the world see an urgency that supersedes the importance of attempting to justify the concept, and is subsequently used to confront significant injustices (p317).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Human rights can be seen as primarily ethical demands. They are not principally “legal,” “proto-legal” or “ideal-legal” commands. Even though human rights can, and often do, inspire legislation, this is a further fact, rather than a constitutive characteristic of human rights. {\&}quot;:
Human rights are, in essence, an ethical stance, and any legal discussion is a consequence rather than an inherent fact of human rights (p319).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The importance of human rights relates to the significance of the freedoms that form the subject matter of these rights. Both the opportunity aspect and the process aspect of freedoms can figure in human rights. To qualify as the basis of human rights, the freedoms to be defended or advanced must satisfy some “threshold conditions” of (i)special importance and (ii) social influenceability. {\&}quot;:
Human rights are important because of the freedoms that they allow, both in processes as well as opportunities (p319).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; human rights generate reasons for action for agents who are in a position to help in the promoting or safeguarding of the underlying freedoms. The induced obligations primarily involve the duty to give reasonable consideration to the reasons for action and their practical implications, taking into account the relevant parameters of the individual case. The reasons for action can support both “perfect” obligations as well as “imperfect” ones, which are less precisely characterized. Even though they differ in content, imperfect obligations are correlative with human rights in much the same way as perfect obligations are. In particular, the acceptance of imperfect obligations goes beyond volunteered charity or elective virtues. {\&}quot;:
The duties and obligations that are generated by human rights centre primarily on those who are able to safeguard or promote those freedoms. The obligations should take reasonable consideration of the circumstances of each situation, as well as the justification for action and its implications (p319).
Highlighted on Page 5: The implementation of human rights can go well beyond legislation, and a theory of human rights cannot be sensibly confined within the juridical model in which it is frequently incarcerated.
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; some recognized human rights are not ideally legislated, but are better promoted through other means,including public discussion, appraisal and advocacy {\&}quot;:
The implementation of human rights needs to be a consideration for all aspects of society, not merely that of legislation. Public discourse, advocacy and appraisal are but some of the suggested means to promote human rights (pp319-20).
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; human rights can include significant and influenceable economic and social freedoms. If they cannot be realized because of inadequate institutionalization, then, to work for institutional expansion or reform can be a part of the obligations generated by the recognition of these rights. The current unrealizability of any accepted human right,which can be promoted through institutional or political change, does not, by itself, convert that claim into a non-right. {\&}quot;:
Second generation human rights, such as medical treatment, can be included in notions of human rights, but institutional constraints may, as a consequence, need to be part of the process of realisation (p320).
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The universality of human rights relates to the idea of survivability in unobstructed discussion—open to participation by persons across national boundaries. Partisanship is avoided not so much by taking either a conjunction, or an intersection, of the views respectively held by dominant voices in different societies across the world (including very repressive ones), but through an interactive process, in particular by examining what would survive in public discussion, given a reasonably free flow of information and uncurbed opportunity to discuss differing points of view. Adam Smith’s insistence that ethical scrutiny requires examining moral beliefs from, inter alia, “a certain distance” has a direct bearing on the connection of human rights to global public reasoning. {\&}quot;:
The application of human rights continues to be a challenge - both in its applicability across a diversity of cultures and situations and the reality of assessing such rights. Overcoming dominant or suppressive discourses needs to be undertaken through an interactive process of free flowing information and open discussion of differing views and moral standpoints (p320).
Highlighted on Page 6: proclamations of human rights are to be seen as articulations of ethical demands.
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Like other ethical claims that demand acceptance, there is an implicit presumption in making pronouncements on human rights that the underlying ethical claims will survive open and informed scrutiny. {\&}quot;:
Human rights, if understood as ethical demands, rely on the assumption that they will stand up to open and informed scrutiny (p320).
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; A pronouncement of human rights includes an assertion of the importance of the corresponding freedoms—the freedoms that are identified and privileged in the formulation of the rights in question—and is indeed motivated by that importance. {\&}quot;:
Intricately linked to human rights are the corresponding freedoms (p322). This applies, not only to those who may encroach upon someone else's freedom, but also for everyone to consider how they can ensure those freedoms equally apply to all - these are considered {\&}quot;imperfect obligations{\&}quot; (p321).
Highlighted on Page 7: But it includes, furthermore, an affirmation of the need for others to consider what they can reasonably do to secure the freedom from torture for any person. 
Highlighted on Page 7: for others too (that is, those other than the would-be torturers) there are responsibilities, even though they are less specific and come in the general form of “imperfect obligations” 
Highlighted on Page 8: The perfectly specified demand not to torture anyone is supplemented by the more general, and less exactly specified, requirement to consider the ways and means through which torture can be prevented and then to decide what one should, thus, reasonably do
Comment on Page 8, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Even though recognitions of human rights (with their associated claims and obligations) are ethical affirmations, they need not, by them-selves, deliver a complete blueprint for evaluative assessment. An agreement on human rights does involve a firm commitment, to wit, to give reasonable consideration to the duties that follow from that ethical endorsement. But even with agreement on these affirmations, there can still be serious debates, particularly in the case of imperfect obligations,on (i) the ways in which the attention that is owed to human rights should be best paid, (ii) how the different types of human rights should be weighed against each other and their respective demands integrated together, (iii) how the claims of human rights should be consolidated with other evaluative concerns that may also deserve ethical attention,and so on.8 {\&}quot;:
The recognition of human rights as an ethical obligation may not be sufficient in creating an evaluative assessment of the current situation, nor does it provide a framework by which appropriate actions follow. Issues around how much focus should be put on them in general, how each compare to other human rights, how claims should be evaluated in light of other concerns (p322).
Highlighted on Page 8: The admissibility of a
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; domain of continued dispute is no embarrassment to a theory of human rights. 10 {\&}quot;:
Sen admits that his approach is by no means complete, nor does he apologise for its incompleteness. In fact, he suggests that this incompleteness is somewhat essential, and provides an avenue for open public debate on human rights matters and their application in varying circumstance (pp322-3).
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; In practical applications of human rights, such debates are, of course,quite common and entirely customary, particularly among human rights activists. What is being argued here is that the possibility of such debates—without losing the basic recognition of the importance of human rights—is not just a feature of what can be called human rights practice, they are actually part of the general discipline of human rights including the underlying theory (rather than being an embarrassment to that discipline). {\&}quot;:
Debates around human rights are a possibility due to the nature of human rights themselves (p323). Subsequently, human rights discourse can often include significant internal variations, whilst still holding consistent the fundamental freedoms inherent in the discourse (p323).
Highlighted on Page 9: A theory of human rights can, therefore, allow considerable internal variations, without losing the commonality of the agreed principle of attaching substantial importance to human rights(and to the corresponding freedoms and obligations) and of being committed to considering seriously how that importance should be appropriately reflected.
Comment on Page 13, on highlighted text {\&}quot; There can, in fact, be little doubt that the idea of moral rights can serve, and has often served in practice, as the basis of new legislation. It has frequently been utilized in this way, and this is indeed an important use of human rights. {\&}quot;:
Moral rights can, and have, served as the foundation for new legislation; this use serves as an important function of human rights (p327).
Highlighted on Page 14: Since declarations of human rights are ethical affirmations of the need to pay appropriate attention to the significance of freedoms incorporated in the formulation of human rights(as was discussed in the last section), an appropriate starting point must be the importance of freedoms of human beings to be so recognized.
Highlighted on Page 14: Note that while rights involve claims (specifically, claims on others who are in a position to make a difference), freedoms, in contrast, are primarily descriptive characteristics of the conditions of persons.23
Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; By starting from the importance of freedoms as the appropriate human condition on which to concentrate, rather than on utilities (as Bentham did), we get a motivating reason not only for celebrating our own rights and liberties, but also for our taking an interest in the significant freedoms of others, not just in their pleasures and desire-fulfillment (as under utilitarianism). {\&}quot;:
Understanding the importance of freedoms - the conditions an individual possesses - motives society to explore the freedoms of others. Rights, on the other hand, involve claims on others to provide the individual with freedoms (p328).
Comment on Page 15, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Freedoms can vary in importance and also in terms of the extent to which they can be influenced by social help.For a freedom to count as a part of the evaluative system of human rights, it clearly must be important enough to justify requiring that others should be ready to pay substantial attention to decide what they can reasonably do to advance it. It also has to satisfy a condition of plausibility that others could make a material difference through taking such an interest. {\&}quot;:
Considerations around freedoms must account for both its importance and ability for change: freedoms must be judged as important for others to dedicate their time and energy, as well as plausibly attainable (p329).
Highlighted on Page 16: The exclusion of a “right to tranquillity” relates not to any skepticism about the possible importance of tranquillity and the significance of a person’s being free to achieve it, but to the difficulty of guaranteeing it through social help
Comment on Page 17, on highlighted text {\&}quot; loses freedom in two different ways, related respectively to (1) being forced with no freedom of choice, and (2) being obliged in particular to do something she would not choose to do.27Both processes and opportunities can figure in human rights. A denial of “due process” in being, say, imprisoned without a proper trial can be the subject matter of human rights (no matter what the outcome {\&}quot;:
Freedom constitutes two separate but interdependent aspects: substantive opportunities is the choices available to her and freedom of processes is her ability to choose between those opportunities (p331). MY THOUGHTS - an example of this is Iran's stance on equality - prior to the revolution women were required to not wear the hijjab, after the revolution they were required to wear the hijjab - neither option gave them the freedom to choose, which is what they were seeking.
Highlighted on Page 18: For the opportunity aspect of freedom, the idea of “capability” (that is, the opportunity to achieve valuable combinations of human functionings: what a person is able to do or be) can typically provide a helpful approach.28It allows us to distinguish appropriately between (1) what she values doing or being, and (2) the means she has to achieve what she values.

Capability is a central concept of Sen's work, and focuses on an individuals ability to achieve what he or she values (p332).
Comment on Page 18, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the capability perspective allows us to take into account the parametric variability in the relation between the means, on the one hand, and the actual opportunities, on the other.29 {\&}quot;:
The capability approach takes account of actual limitations to achieve a goal, whether or not that goal is legally and socially feasible (p332).
Comment on Page 21, on highlighted text {\&}quot; A strong argument can be constructed in favor of an immigrant’s having the freedom to retain at least parts of her ancestral life-style, but this must not be seen as an argument in favor of her pursuing her ancestral life-style whether she chooses to do this or not. {\&}quot;:
Capabilities are about the opportunities available to the person, and do not constitute an argument for or against the actual choices they make from those opportunities (p335).
Comment on Page 22, on highlighted text {\&}quot; I have been concentrating on what the capability perspective can do for a theory of justice or of human rights in the immediately preceding discussion, but I now to turn to what it cannot do. Although the idea of capability has considerable merit in the assessment of the opportunity aspect of freedom, it cannot possibly deal adequately with the process aspect of freedom, since capabilities are characteristics of individual advantages, and they fall short of telling us enough about the fairness or equity of the processes involved, or about the freedom of citizens to invoke and utilize procedures that are equitable. {\&}quot;:
Whilst discussions on capabilities is effective for a theory of justice and the discussion of human rights, it does not address how to overcome deficits (p336).
Comment on Page 23, on highlighted text {\&}quot; A theory of justice, or more generally an adequate theory of normative collective choice, has to be alive both to the fairness of the processes involved and to the equity and efficiency of the substantive opportunities that people can enjoy.38In dealing with the latter,capability can indeed provide a very helpful perspective, in comparison with, say, the Rawlsian concentration on “primary goods.” But capability can hardly serve as the sole informational basis for the other considerations, related to processes, that must also be accommodated in normative collective choice theory. {\&}quot;:
Theories of justice often cover matters of the current state of existence - what an individual is capable of undertaking. Regarding the process involved and the equity of those opportunities, this aspect is often not adequately taken into account through the information gained in this process (p337).
Highlighted on Page 24: Capabilities and the opportunity aspect of freedom, important as they are, have to be supplemented by considerations of fair processes and the lack of violation of the individual’s right to invoke and utilize them.

Comment on Page 25, on highlighted text {\&}quot; However, that sense of distance is largely illusory. The difference would indeed involve an immense escalation if the duty in question were not one of giving reasonable consideration to a possible action, but an absolute obligation to undertake that action, no matter what other values one has and what other commitments one has reason to consider.But that way of seeing one’s duties—as compulsory action—is not only at some distance from the acknowledgment of reasons for action, but it also lacks cogency, and even internal coherence. There are many fine deeds for each of which a reason for action exists, but it would typically be impossible to carry out the totality of all those deeds. There is a need for the assessment of priorities and for discrimination in the way the obligation to give reasonable consideration may be followed up by sensible choices of action. {\&}quot;:
Sen discusses the reasons an individual might act to overcome injustices, and the difference between an individual knowing there is a reason to the obligation one might feel towards action (p338). He suggests that the latter should not be considered a compulsory action, but arises from a reasoned consideration of possibilities (p339).
Comment on Page 25, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the determination not to get into a pandemonium of practical reasoning is not a ground for denying that one does have a duty to give reasonable consideration to what one can sensibly do for the rights, and the underlying significant and influenceable freedoms, of others. The demands of reasonable consideration would varywith a great many parameters that may be relevant to a person’s practical reasoning.42 {\&}quot;:
Sen's theory of human rights acknowledges the importance of individuals giving due consideration to how they can advocate for the rights and freedoms of others (p339). In addition to a more general possibility for advocacy, Sen identifies that individuals need to give particular thought to specific cases in which they are likely to be able influence, inter alia in their own lives and other claims towards freedoms and rights (p339).
Highlighted on Page 25: Even though the acknowledgment that certain freedoms qualify as human rights already reflects an assessment of their general importance and their possible influenceability (discussed in Section IV ),a person has to go beyond these pervasive features into more specific circumstances in giving reasonable consideration to what he or she, in particular, should do in a specific case.

In their latter role, moral principles impose {\&}quot;informational con- straints,{\&}quot; demanding that certain types of information should not be allowed to influence the moral judgments to be made. {\&}quot;:
Information is needed to determine how moral principles apply, or don't apply. Similarly, certain information should not be allowed to influence particular moral judgements (pp169-70).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; If two actions are factually identical, then universalizability (seen by Hare as a necessity due to the meaning of moral language) will require that they be morally equivalent. {\&}quot;:
Sen argues that, if relevant information between two situations are identical, then they are also morally equivalent and should be treated as such (p172).
Highlighted on Page 5: The relevance of this line of reasoning does, however, depend on 
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the interpretation of the idea of {\&}quot;identity{\&}quot; in dealing with univer- salizability of moral judgments. There is an exacting sense in which it can be said that two factual circumstances are never exactly identi- cal. The notion of identity used in the application of universaliza- bility is based on some informational constraint, ruling out some differences as irrelevan {\&}quot;:
Sen goes on to explore the challenges of assuming that any individual circumstance is, in actuality, identical (p173).
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; moral approaches are similarly constrained by the availability of information {\&}quot;:
The choice of moral approach, according to Sen, is limited in its application if information availability is also limited (p174).
Comment on Page 8, on highlighted text {\&}quot; These requirements impose a set of informational constraints, in the form of invariance restrictions linked to specific information types. The isoinformation sets are given by the factored conditions individually or jointly. For example, in judging states of affairs, welfarism would put two states in the same isoinformation set if they are identical in terms of utility (i.e., if they are mapped onto the same point in the n-dimensional utility space, in an n-person society). If sum ranking is also imposed, this requires further that two states must belong to the same isoinformation set whenever they have the same utility total (even if they are mapped onto different points in the n-dimensional utility space). Finally, additionally imposing a minimal (direction-neutral) version of act consequen- tialism will put two acts (even though they are different acts) in the same isoinformation set if the two states of affairs they respectively yield have the same utility total. And that, of course, takes us more or less all the way to act utilitarianism (all we need further is a {\&}quot;directional{\&}quot; axiom that says the more the better). In assessing act utilitarianism (and any other moral system), it is important to ex- amine both what information it regards as appropriate and what information it constrains out as irrelevant and unusable. {\&}quot;:
Outcome utilitarianism primarily considers the effect its application has on the individual or society, and hence two approaches are identical if the total utility outcome is equal (p175).
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The idea of pluralism vis-a-vis monism not only is ambiguous, but also is sometimes viewed in a way that has no essential relation to the feature of plurality. A common approach seems to take the form of identifying the use of plurality of principles with intui- tionism.{\&}quot; Pluralism is a claim about the form of moral structures, whereas intuitionism-unless radically redefined-is a claim about how the moral structure may be derived and supported (i.e., whether by intuition only). The two things are not essentially related. The suggestion that if there are many ultimate principles (and they are not in a hierarchy), then the balance among them must be struck by intuition, is, of course, completely baseless. John Rawls, who does restrict the term 'intuitionism' to pluralist moral theories, does at least make clear that {\&}quot;a conception of justice can be plural- ist without requiring us to weigh its principles by intuition.,,2 {\&}quot;:
Pluralism suggests that the multitude of moral principles are fundamentally equal, and they form a moral structure. Intuitionalism discusses how this moral structure is derived and supported, and there is a suggested link between them through application, in that intuition allows the individual to make the choice as to which moral principle to apply. However Rawls rejects pluralistic justice being so dependent on intuition (p176).
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Even when the confusing identification of pluralism with intui- tionism has been rejected, there remain at least two different ways of defining pluralism. One is in terms of plurality of principles (I shall call this principle pluralism), and the other in terms of plurality of informational variables (to be called information pluralism) {\&}quot;:
Pluralism can take on different forms, dictating the different variables in each consideration: principle pluralism identifies the variety or applicable principles that can be used, while information pluralism explores the applicability of various pieces of information (p176).
Comment on Page 12, on highlighted text {\&}quot; problem of decision making under those circumstances. To quote Dewey and Tufts: The struggle is not between a good which is clear to him and some- thing else which attracts him but which he knows to be wrong. It is between values each of which is an undoubted good in its place but which now get in each other's way. He is forced to reflect in order to come to a decision. Moral theory is a generalized extension of the kind of thinking in which he now engages.32 Decision making with unresolved conflicts is part of a more gen- eral problem, viz., decision making with incomplete rankings.{\&}quot; We may begin by noting that incomplete rankings may have to be faced even with one ultimate principle of valuation. The most ob- vious reason for this is the limitation of informational availability. For example, partial comparability of utilities-in interpersonal correspondences-will make the utilitarian ranking a partial order- ing.34 It can also be argued that partial comparability of utilities may be caused not only by the actual limitation of factual knowl- edge, but also by the intrinsic nature of interpersonal utility com- parisons. Utilities may not, in this view, be things that can, even in principle, be fully compared between persons, leading to an exact one-to-one correspondence of the utility measures (levels, units, etc.) of different persons.35 The incompleteness of the utilitarian ranking would, on this view, be unremovable through richer factual knowledge. In these circumstances, a pure utilitarian would have to assert the incompleteness of moral ranking as the correct moral position. {\&}quot;:
Challenges arise when varying moral principles seem to derive oppositional outcomes, and there is no clear hierarchical assertion that one principle is preferable in a particular circumstance (p179).
Comment on Page 13, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Yielding complete orders cannot be an a priori requirement of the legitimacy of a moral principle, or even of an entire moral approach with its full structure of principles. It is not a matter of getting metamoral passmarks. It does not determine a substantive moral approach, but rather gets determined by such an approach, which could yield completeness of valuations or not {\&}quot;:
Sen asserts that there cannot be an overall hierarchy of moral structure, but that the hierarchy is determined according to the situation at hand (p180).
Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; It is often pointed out that in real life we have to choose some- thing or other-we must decide, we must act. This is certainly so, and we must end up doing something or other, if only nothing, by default. If our actions are to be morally guided, then our incomplete moral valuations must be used to eliminate some alternatives, while permitting others.37 We must not act like a moral counterpart of Buridan's ass-needlessly starving by default, unable to figure out which of the nonstarving alternatives happened to be the best.38 Intelligent moral choice demands that we not choose-explicitly or by default-an alternative that we can see is morally inferior to another feasible alternative. But this does not require that the chosen alternative be seen to be {\&}quot;best{\&}quot; in that set of feasible alternatives, since there may be no best alternative at all, given the incomplete- ness of our moral ranking. {\&}quot;:
The reality of ascertaining the particular principle according to the circumstances suggests that there will always be one principle which has a better outcome than all the others. Whilst one principle can easily be dismissed if it is inferior to others in potential outcome, some may be equal, in which case we must be conscious not to err on the side of inaction (unless that is what the principle dictates) because one is not able to decide which is the better of the two principles (p181).
Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; One source of informational pluralism is the possibility that acts themselves may have value or disvalue, distinct from the valuation of states resulting from such acts. {\&}quot;:
One consideration which may contribute to the guiding principle may be whether the acts themselves give added value, distinct from the outcomes of those acts (p181).
Highlighted on Page 15: This feature of utilitarian- ism is welfarism, and it is a feature that is shared by some other approaches, such as utility-based {\&}quot;maximin{\&}quot; (seeing the goodness of a state as the utility level of the worst-off individual in that state. )
Comment on Page 16, on highlighted text {\&}quot; A position- relative valuation function builds in the parameter of the assessor's position within the valuation function itself.42 Consider the follow- ing imaginary remark of Appian to Brutus: {\&}quot;If I were you, Brutus, I should have evaluated the state to be even worse than I do now, not having been involved in the knifing of Caesar myself.{\&}quot; The statement is of the form f (x,a,b) {\&}lt; f (x,a,a), in which f (x,a,b) is the valuation of the state x by a (Appian) in the position of b (Brutus), and f (x,a,a), the valuation made by Appian from his own position. Notice that the relativity in question links not to the authorship (the second variable), but to the position from which the evaluation is being made (the third variable), i.e., whether a's position or b's. The authorship is immaterial for {\&}quot;position relativity{\&}quot; of a moral system {\&}quot;:
The perspective of the individual making the moral decision may also influence the evaluation of the situation - one person may view the situation better or worse, and hence their evaluation of the situation is affected (P183). Yet this is distinct from the act itself.
Comment on Page 17, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The possibility of combining position relativity with authorship invariance is also the reason why positionality of moral valuation is perfectly consistent with objectivity of moral values. Moral valua- tion can be position-relative in the same way as such statements as {\&}quot;The sun is setting.{\&}quot; The truth of that statement varies with the position of the person, but it cannot vary from person to person among those standing in the same position. The aspect of objectiv- ity related to authorship invariance, i.e., to f (x,a,b) = f (x,b,b), for all x, a, and b, has to be, I believe, a part of what Thomas Nagel calls objectivity in {\&}quot;the primary sense{\&}quot;-that of {\&}quot;beliefs and knowledge. {\&}quot;44 {\&}quot;:
The importance of perception versus authorship is illuminated by statements such as {\&}quot;the sun is setting{\&}quot;; this statement is true for individuals situated in the same position, yet for someone positioned elsewhere this statement is false (p184).

Sen, in his Dewey lectures on well-being, agency and freedom, discusses the intricacies of a moral social framework.
Highlighted on Page 18: the use of this informa- tional foundation by the more descriptive (though much less ele- gant) name 'well-being as informational foundation', or WAIF for short.3 
Comment on Page 19, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Indeed it is useful to distinguish clearly between the {\&}quot;well-being aspect{\&}quot; and the {\&}quot;agency aspect{\&}quot; of a person. John Rawls's {\&}quot;Kantian constructivism,{\&}quot; in his Dewey lectures,4 started at the agency end- with {\&}quot;persons characterized as rational agents of construction.{\&}quot; Persons were seen as {\&}quot;having the moral power to have a concep- tion of the good{\&}quot;; the agency role-broadly construed-came first, and other things followed. Although I shall not follow Rawls's route of Kantian constructivism, I would argue that the conception of {\&}quot;persons{\&}quot; in moral analysis cannot be so reduced as to attach no intrinsic importance to this agency role, seeing them ultimately only in terms of their well-being. {\&}quot;:
Agency and well-being are distinct in that an individual is considered a {\&}quot;rational agent of construction{\&}quot; in their actions and morality was central to that, hence this agency is the source of well-being, inter alia (p186).
Comment on Page 20, on highlighted text {\&}quot; For an integrated person it is likely-possibly even inevitable- that the person's well-being will be influenced by his or her agency role. This does not, however, imply that the well-being informa- tion itself could capture the important features of agency, or act as its informational surrogate. In fact, some types of agency roles, e.g., those related to fulfilling obligations, can quite possibly have a negative impact on the person's well-being. Even when the impact is positive, the importance of the agency aspect has to be distin- guished from the importance of the impact of agency on well- being. {\&}quot;:
Agency and well-being are not interdependent, and whilst agency itself is important, the impact of agency on well-being is a distinct aspect for consideration (p187).

READ FROM HERE!!!
Comment on Page 21, on highlighted text {\&}quot; t a person's choice may be guided by a number of motives of which the pursuit of personal well-being is only one. The well-being motivation may well be dominant in some choices, but not in others. Moral considerations may, inter alia, influence a person's {\&}quot;commitment.{\&}quot;'10 The mixture of motivations makes it hard to form a good idea of a person's well-being on the basis of choice information only.{\&}quot; {\&}quot;:
Choice, while the preferred economic approach, can be influenced by a multitude of factors, well-being representing only on such factor (P188).
Comment on Page 21, on highlighted text {\&}quot; happiness has two basic problems in its claim to stand for well-being. First, as it is interpreted in the utilitarian tradition, happiness is basically a mental state, and it ignores other aspects of a person's well-being. If a starving wreck, ravished by famine, buffeted by disease, is made happy through some mental conditioning (say, via the {\&}quot;opium{\&}quot; of religion), the person will be seen as doing well on this mental-state perspective, but that would be quite scandalous. Second, as a mental-state concept, the perspective of happiness may give a very limited view of other mental activities {\&}quot;:
Attempting to view well-being on the basis of happiness, while more plausible, has some significant challenges: happiness being a mental state undoubtedly overlooks other conditions, and while the individual be experiencing happiness as derived from mental conditioning (eg the {\&}quot;opium{\&}quot; of religion), the individual could simultaneously be suffering from physical ailments. It would be misguided to suggest that this person's well-being is positive (p188).
Comment on Page 22, on highlighted text {\&}quot; other than being just happy, such as stimulation, excitement, etc., which are of direct relevance to a person's well-being {\&}quot;:
Individual well-being is also positively associated with other aspects of mental acuity (p189).
Comment on Page 22, on highlighted text {\&}quot; . It is hard to avoid the conclusion that although happiness is of obvious and direct rele- vance to well-being, it is inadequate as a representation of well-being {\&}quot;:
Whilst happiness is an element of well-being, it is not, in its entirety, an adequate representation of well-being (p189).
Comment on Page 22, on highlighted text {\&}quot; An account of well-being that is to serve as a basis for a utilitarian calculus must be able to present a cardinal and interpersonally comparable view of utility. Neither of these types of information can be ob- tained just by checking whether the person's desires have been real- ized in the state of the world {\&}quot;:
The basis for using desire as a means to establish well-being also has its flaws. Desires may not need to be realised for the individual to attain well-being (p189).
Comment on Page 27, on highlighted text {\&}quot; It is, in fact, not surprising that the relevance of equality in moral valuation cannot be settled without assessing equality itself. The informational foundation of well-being yielded by WAIF leaves it open how the well-being of different people are to be combined in assessing states and actions. And this issue is not obliterated even when {\&}quot;rational{\&}quot; behavior under uncertainty with primordial equi- probability is taken to be the basis of moral valuation. Rationality- even in the limited sense of satisfying von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms-is no enemy of valuing equality of well-being. {\&}quot;:
Whether equality is central to moral valuation depends on one's assessment of equality, which also needs to be assessed according to the information used to assess well-being (p194).
Comment on Page 27, on highlighted text {\&}quot; While the issue of equality has to be faced, the fact that there are many different notions of equality implies that conflicts among these different egalitarian views have to be faced as well. In an im- portant study called Equalities, Douglas Rae has argued that the {\&}quot;one idea that is more powerful than order or efficiency or freedom in resisting equality{\&}quot; is {\&}quot;equality itself.{\&}quot;23 Peter Westen has gone further and has suggested that equality is {\&}quot;an empty form having no substantive content of its own.{\&}quot; 24 {\&}quot;:
When considering equality, there also needs to be consideration of different notions of equality (p194).
Highlighted on Page 28: However, the multiplicity of notions of equality arises from var- ious sources, and often enough these sources do not appear to be peculiar to equality at all. A person's advantage can be judged in many different ways, and corresponding to these different ways, there are various characterizations of equality. Utility, income, opulence, need-fulfillment, etc., provide different ways of seeing a person's success, and each of them would lead to a corresponding approach to equality. But this plurality is not special to equality. Any derivative notion for which individual advantage provides the informational base, would have this plurality
Comment on Page 30, on highlighted text {\&}quot; One important difference between the two cases relates to the likely fact that the expensive-taste person may be able to do most things a normal person can and be handicapped only in the context of achieving contentment or satisfaction, whereas the disabled per- son may be handicapped in terms of a much wider range of activi- ties.27 As Scanlon describes the refined being, he could not be raised to a {\&}quot;normal level of satisfaction{\&}quot; without very high expenditure (659). {\&}quot;:
{\&}lt;blockquote{\&}gt;When considering well-being, one must consider the inherent limitations that affect an individual reaching a normal level of satisfaction, such as disability. A disabled person, irrespective of wealth available to him, may never be able to reach the same satisfaction, and if they were, the costs are likely to be significantly higher (pp196-7).{\&}amp;nbsp;{\&}lt;/blockquote{\&}gt;
Comment on Page 30, on highlighted text {\&}quot; In fact, handicapped people are often cheerful enough, and do not lead a life of frustrated desires, since their desires adapt to the reality of their handicap {\&}quot;:
Yet often disabled people have a more positive outlook on life, not focusing on their frustrated desires (p197); their base capabilities are not based on others abilities.
Comment on Page 31, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The contrast between opulence and functioning achievements is simple enough, but its significance in the context of well-being may be worth spelling out.

abstract = {In Development as Freedom Amartya Sen quotes the eighteenth century poet William Cowper on freedom: Freedom has a thousand charms to show, That slaves howe'er contented, never know. Sen explains how in a world of unprecedented increase in overall opulence, millions of people living in rich and poor countries are still unfree. Even if they are not technically slaves, they are denied elementary freedom and remain imprisoned in one way or another by economic poverty, socialdeprivation, political tyranny or cultural authoritarianism. The main purpose of development is to spread freedom and its 'thousand charms' to the unfree citizens. Freedom, Sen persuasively argues, is at once the ultimate goal of social and economic arrangements and the most efficient means of realizing general welfare. Social institutions like markets, political parties, legislatures, the judiciary, and the media contribute to development by enhancing individual freedom and are in turnsustained by social values. Values, institutions, development, and freedom are all closely interrelated, and Sen links them together in an elegant analytical framework. By asking "What is the relation between our collective economic wealth and our individual ability to live as we would like?" and by incorporating individual freedom as a social commitment into his analysis, Sen allows economics once again, as it did in the time of Adam Smith, to address the social basis of individual well-beingand freedom.},

Wealth is useful in what it allows individuals to accomplish; these accomplishments are often thought of in terms of substantive freedoms. However wealth is not the only means to accomplish these freedoms, not does the same level of wealth afford the same level of freedoms for all. Freedoms need to be considered in terms of processes and opportunities (the focus of libertarians and consequentialists respectively) (p17).

Highlighted on Page 2: combinations of things a person is able to do or be – the various ‘functionings’ he or she can achieve.2
Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The capability approach to a person’s advantage is concerned with evaluating it in terms of his or her actual ability to achieve various valuable functionings as a part of living. The corresponding approach to social advantage – for aggregative appraisal as well as for the choice of institutions and policy – takes the sets of individual capabilities as constituting an indispensable and central part of the relevant informational base of such evaluation. {\&}quot;:
Capability approach centres on an individual's advantage to achieve what they value to function in life. This approach is used to evaluate social advantage and disadvantage, and also assists in understanding the place of institutional policy (p271).
Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Functionings Represent parts of the state of a person – in particular the various things that he or she manages to do or be in leading a life. The Capability Of a person reflects the alternative combinations of functionings the person can achieve, and from which he or she can choose one collection.4The approach is based on a view of living as a combination of various ‘doings and beings’,with quality of life to be assessed in terms of the capability to achieve valuable functionings. {\&}quot;:
Capabilities are what a person is free to do or be, but these capabilities are combinations of various functions. These functions are abilities and states of existence that provide a foundation for possible actions (p271). For example, if an individual has the function to read and write, regularly watches the news and can also drive, they are more likely to be able to get to the polling booths and cast an informed vote.
Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; In The context of some types of social analysis, for example, in dealing with extreme poverty in developing economies, we may be able to go a fairly long distance with a relatively small number of centrally important functionings and the corresponding basic capabilities (e.g. the ability to be well nourished and well sheltered, the capability of escaping avoidable morbidity and premature mortality, and so forth). In other contexts, including more general problems of economic development, the list may have to be much longer and much more diverse. {\&}quot;:
Functions and capabilities vary according to the social setting and the priorities different cultures place on various capabilities (p272).
Highlighted on Page 3: The need for selection and discrimination is neither an embarrassment, nor a unique difficulty, for the conceptualization of functioning and capability.

Comment on Page 3, on highlighted text {\&}quot; In An evaluative exercise, we can distinguish between two different questions:(1)What Are the objects of value? (2)How Valuable Are the respective objects? {\&}quot;:
In assessing the priorities, both establishing what is valued is as important as establishing their value in respect to each other (p272).
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The selection of the evaluative space has a good deal of cutting power on its own, both because of what it includes as potentially valuable and because of what it excludes.For Example, because of the nature of the evaluative space,the capability approach differs from utilitarian evaluation (more generally ‘welfarist’ evaluation 8)in making room for a variety of human acts and states as important in themselves (not just because they may produce utility,nor just to the extent that they yield utility).9 It Also makes room for valuing various freedoms – in the form of capabilities. On the other side, the approach does not attach direct – as opposed to derivative – importance to the means of living or means of freedom (e.g. real income, wealth, opulence,primary goods, or resources), as some other approaches do. These variables are not part of the evaluative space, though they can indirectly influence the evaluation through their effects on variables included in that space. {\&}quot;:
The capabilities approach accepts that particular states are valuable irrespective of other possibilities they may also bring (p273).
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The freedom to lead different types of life is reflected in the person’s capability set. The capability of a person depends on a variety of factors, including personal characteristics and social arrangements. A full accounting of individual freedom must, of course, go beyond the capabilities of personal living and pay attention to the person’s other objectives (e.g. social goals not directly related to one’s own life), but human capabilities constitute an important part of individual freedom. {\&}quot;:
An individual's capability set constitutes the various freedoms that an individual is able to accomplish, and should also include social settings and personal characteristics (p273).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; if an underlying idea has an essential ambiguity, a precise formulation of that idea must try to capture that ambiguity rather than hide or eliminate it.10 {\&}quot;:
Obscure or hidden functions, such as an individual's confidence to undertake such a task, should not be ignored in attempting to understand the individual's freedoms (p274).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Comparisons of freedom raise interesting issues of evaluation. The claims sometimes made that freedom must be valued independently of the values and preferences of the person whose freedom is being assessed, since it concerns the ‘range’ of choice a person has –not how she values the elements in that range or what she chooses from it. {\&}quot;:
Differentiating between different people's freedoms is also problematic, as each person may place a different hierarchical structure on their freedoms (p274).
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; We Can make a fourfold classification of points of evaluative interest in assessing human advantage, based on two different distinctions. One Distinction is between (1.1) the promotion of the person's well-being, and(1.2) the pursuit of the person’s overall agency goals.The latter encompassesthe goals that a person has reasons to adopt, which can inter alia include goals other than the advancement of his or her own well-being. It can thus generate orderings different from that of well-being. The second distinction is between (2.1)achievement, and (2.2) the freedom to achieve.This contrast can be applied both to the perspective of well-being and to that of agency.The two distinctions together yield four different concepts of advantage,related to a person: (1) ‘well-being achievement’, (2) ‘agency achievement’,(3) ‘well-being freedom’, and (4) ‘agency freedom’. These different notions,which I have tried to discuss more extensively elsewhere, are not, of course,unrelated to each other, but nor are they necessarily identical.17 {\&}quot;:
When assessing human advantage, Sen proposes to do so according to well-being and agency. These are both considered in light of an individual's achievements as well as their freedom to achieve. According to Sen, this analysis can identify four areas of individual advantage: 'well-being achievement'; 'agency achievement'; well-being freedom'; and 'agency freedom' (p275).
Comment on Page 6, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The assessment of each of these four types of benefit involves an evaluative exercise, but they are not the same evaluative exercise. They can also have very disparate bearings on matters to which the evaluation and comparison of individual advantages are relevant. For example, in determining whether a person is deprived in a way that calls for assistance from others or from the state, a person’s well-being may be, arguably, more relevant than his agency success (e.g. the state may have better grounds for offering support to a person for overcoming hunger or illness than for helping him to build a monument to his hero, even if he himself attaches more importance to the monument than to the removal of his hunger or illness). Furthermore, for adult citizens,well-being freedom may be more relevant to state policy, in this context, than well-being achievement(e.g. the state may have reason to offer a person adequate opportunities to overcome hunger, but not to insist that he must take up that offer and cease to be hungry). Interpersonal comparisons can be of many distinct types, with possibly dissimilar evaluative interests.Despite the interdependencies between the different value-purposes, they can generate quite distinct exercises with partly divergent concentration and relevance. {\&}quot;:
Each of these measures of advantage are evaluated differently, and are addressed by different entity's (p275).
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; This does not, of course, imply that a person’s well-being cannot be ‘other-regarding’. Rather, the effect of ‘other-regarding’ concerns on one’s well-being has to operate through some feature of the person’s own being. Doing Good may make a person contented or fulfilled, and these are functioning achievements of importance. In this approach, functionings are seen ascentraltothenatureof well-being, even though the source of well-being could easily be external to the person. {\&}quot;:
An individual's 'well-being achievement' can also include an individual's interactions with others, particularly in how it impacts the individual, eg feelings of content or importance (p276).
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The functionings relevant for well-being vary from such elementary ones as escaping morbidity and mortality, being adequately nourished, having mobility, etc., to complex ones such as being happy, achieving self-respect,taking part in the life of the community, appearing in public without shame {\&}quot;:
Well-being functions cover areas of physical, as well as mental, well-being (p276).
Highlighted on Page 7: If The value-purpose is changed from checking the ‘well-ness’ of the person's being to assessing the person’s success in the pursuit of all the objectives that he has reason to promote, then the exercise becomes one of evaluation of ‘agency achievement’, rather than of well-being achievement. For this exercise, the space of functionings may be rather restrictive, since the person's goals may well include other types of objective

For this exercise, the space of functionings may be rather restrictive, since the person's goals may well include other types of objective (going well beyond the person's own state of being). {\&}quot;:
'Agency achievement' focuses on the individuals ability to pursue things they consider valuable (p276).
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; in evaluating the capability set for the value-purpose of assessing well-being achievement, we would simply have to identify the value of the capability set with the value of the achieved functioning n-tuple in it. The procedure of equating the value of the capability set to the value of one of the elements of that set has been called ‘elementary evaluation’.22 {\&}quot;:
Whilst well-being and agency achievement assess an individual based on their states of existence, the capability assessment is based on the individuals ability to pursue a particular achievement if they so choose (p278).
Comment on Page 9, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Second, freedom may have intrinsic importance for the person’s well-being achievement. Acting freely and being able to choose may be directly conducive to well-being, not just because more freedom may make better alternatives available. {\&}quot;:
The mere freedom to choose, or not choose, a particular path or achievement may have a positive impact on the individuals well-being (p278).
Highlighted on Page 9: Even the removal of all the elements of a feasible set (e.g. of a ‘budget set’)other than the chosen best element is seen, in that theory, as no real loss,since the freedom to choose does not, in this view, matter in itself.
Highlighted on Page 10: In Contrast, if choosing is seen as a part of living (and ‘doing x’ is distinguished from ‘choosing to do x and doing it’), then even ‘well-being achievement’ need not be independent of the freedom reflected in the capability set.26 In That case, both ‘well-being achievement’ and ‘well-being freedom' will have to be assessed in terms of capability sets. Both must then involve ‘set evaluation’ in a non-elementary way (i.e. without limiting the usable informational content of capability sets through elementary evaluation).

Capability approach is not limited to what the person does, it extends to what the person might choose to do (p279).
Highlighted on Page 11: Turning to poverty analysis, identifying a minimal combination of basic capabilities can be a good way of setting up the problem of diagnosing and measuring poverty. It can lead to results quite different from those obtained by concentrating on the inadequacy of income as the criterion of identifying the poor.34The conversion of income into basic capabilities may vary greatly between individuals and also between different societies, so that the ability to reach minimally acceptable levels of basic capabilities can go with varying levels of minimally adequate incomes. The income-centred view of poverty, based on specifying an interpersonally invariant ‘poverty line’ income, may be very misleading in the identification and evaluation of poverty.

The income-centred view of poverty, based on specifying an interpersonally invariant ‘poverty line’ income, may be very misleading in the identification and evaluation of poverty. {\&}quot;:
Suggestions about a basic set of capabilities which are crucially important for basic functioning constitute the basis for an effective poverty analysis which goes beyond merely income (p280).
Comment on Page 11, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Since income is not desired for its own sake, any income-based notion of poverty must refer – directly or indirectly – to those basic ends which are promoted by income as means. Indeed, in poverty studies related to less developed countries, the ‘poverty line’ income is often derived explicitly with reference to nutritional norms {\&}quot;:
Assessment of income revolves around the basis that income generates possibilities; the poverty line, for instance, is intricately linked to the cost to maintain nutritional standards. This is a limited understanding of a person's well-being (p280). Minimum standards, however, vary across and within countries in a manner for which the income measure does not account (p280).
Highlighted on Page 11: Once it is recognized that the relation between income and capabilities varies between communities and between people in the same community, the minimally adequate income level for reaching the same minimally acceptable capability levels will be seen as variable – depending on personal and social characteristics.
Comment on Page 11, on highlighted text {\&}quot; However, as long as minimal capabilities can be achieved by enhancing the income level(given the other personal and social characteristics on which capabilities depend), it will be possible (for the specified personal and social characteristics) to identify the minimally adequate income for reaching the minimally acceptable capability levels. Once this correspondence is established,it would not really matter whether poverty is defined in terms of a failure of basic capability or as a failure to have the corresponding minimally adequate income.35 {\&}quot;:
Income is essentially an indicator of capability in certain contexts, and understanding the corresponding desired capacities that are associated with the minimum income facilitates essentially the same discussion of disadvantage (p280).
Comment on Page 12, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the most powerful conceptual connections would appear to be with the Aristotelian view of the human good. Martha Nussbaum (1988,1990) has discussed illuminatingly the Aristotelian analysis of ‘political distribution’,and its relation to the capability approach. The Aristotelian account of the human good is explicitly linked with the necessity to ‘first ascertain the function of man’ and it then proceeds to explore ‘life in the sense of activity’.37 {\&}quot;:
Aristotle's concept of human good also discusses the importance of capabilities and achievements (p281).
Highlighted on Page 12: The basis of a fair distribution of capability to function is given a central place in the Aristotelian theory of political distribution.
Comment on Page 12, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Aristotle Believes, as Nussbaum (1988)notes, ‘that there is just one list of functionings (at least at a certain level of generality) that do in fact constitute human good living’ (p. 152). That view would not be inconsistent with the capability approach presented here, {\&}quot;:
Whilst Aristotle talked of a particular list of functionings, the capability approach acknowledges the formation of a list may be limiting in the historical and social variations it may be adopted (p281).
Highlighted on Page 13: the capability approach as such does not require taking that route, and the deliberate incompleteness of the capability approach permits other routes to be taken which also have some plausibility. It is,in fact, the feasibility as well as the usefulness of a general approach (to be distinguished from a complete evaluative blueprint) that seems to me to provide good grounds for separating the general case for the capability approach (including,inter alia, the Aristotelian theory) from the special case for taking on exclusively this particular Aristotelian theory.
Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Quite different specific theories of value may be consistent with the capability approach, and share the common feature of selecting value-objects from functionings and capabilities. Further, the capability approach can be used with different methods of determining relative weights and different mechanisms for actual evaluation. The approach, if seen as a theory of algorithmic evaluation, would be clearly incomplete.40 It May well be asked: why pause at outlining a general approach, with various bits to be filled in, rather than ‘completing the task’? The motivation underlying the pause relates to the recognition that an agreement on the usability of the capability approach – an agreement on the nature of the ‘space’ of value-objects – need not presuppose an agreement on how the valuational exercise may be completed. It is possible to disagree both on the exact grounds underlying the determination of relative weights, and on the actual relative weights chosen,41 even when there is reasoned agreement on the general nature of the value-objects (in this case, personal functionings and capabilities). If reasoned agreement is seen as an important foundational quality central to political and social ethics,42 then the case for the pause is not so hard to understand. The fact that the capability approach is consistent and combinable with several different substantive theories need not be a source of embarrassment. {\&}quot;:
Critiques of the capabilities approach often revolve around it's relative incompleteness as an evaluation tool. This, however, seems a deliberate and conscious choice by Sen. It is suggested that the overall framework allows individuals, individual situations, and specific societies to take the capabilities principles and use them according to their own volition - making judgements about what that circumstance values and freedoms that are important to them which are likely to be distinct from other circumstances (p283).

Development is often viewed from one of two perspectives: a fierce process where wisdom demands toughness, and a decisive and considered disregard for particular approaches such as social services, certain rights and the democracy; or a warmer process exemplified by mutually beneficial initiaives, social safety nets, liberties, social development and other supportive initiatives (p35). Sen suggests that, since freedoms is a process as well as a result, that the latter approach is more conducive to the process of expanding freedoms (p35).

Economic freedoms are concerned with an individuals ability to {\&}quot;utilise economic resources for the purpose of consumption, or production, or exchange{\&}quot; (pp38-9).

Comment on Page 27, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The underlying issue is whether we have to agree on one specific line of censure for a reasoned consensus on the diagnosis of an injustice that calls for urgent rectification. What is important to note here, as central to the idea of justice, is that we can have a strong sense of injustice on many different grounds, and yet not agree on one particular ground as being the dominant reason for the diagnosis of injustice. {\&}quot;:
Injustice can manifest itself in many ways, and there may not be a need for a unified notion how to combat injustices to be able to identify the injustices themselves (p2).
Comment on Page 29, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Arbitrary reduction of multiple and potentially conflicting principles to one solitary survivor, guillotining all the other evaluative criteria, is not, in fact, a prerequisite for getting useful and robust conclusions on what should be done. This applies as much to the theory of justice as it does to any other part of the discipline of practical reason. {\&}quot;:
When there is a plurality of principles by which one should make a decision, reducing those to one arbitrarily, is not a requirement for effective decision making, nor is it an effective process for general reasoning or a theory of justice (p4).
Comment on Page 29, on highlighted text {\&}quot; a calamity would be a case of injustice only if it could have been prevented, and particularly if those who could have undertaken preventive action had failed to try. Reasoning in some form cannot but be involved in moving from the observation of a tragedy to the diagnosis of injustice. Furthermore, cases of injustice may be much more complex and subtle than the assessment of an observable calamity. There could be different arguments suggesting disparate conclusions, and evaluations of justice may be anything but straightforward. {\&}quot;:
Injustices are extensive, yet to create an outcry of injustice is likely to only be effective if it could have been prevented, and blaming individuals or groups is only beneficial if those who have taken responsibility to prevent it did not attempt to do so (p4). Injustices are often complex in their origins and their effects, their protagonists and their remedies (p4).
Comment on Page 29, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The avoidance of reasoned justification often comes not from indignant protesters but from placid guardians of order and justice. Reticence has appealed throughout history to those with a governing role,endowed with public authority, who are unsure of the grounds for action, or unwilling to scrutinize the basis of their policies. {\&}quot;:
Public authority figures - those in a position to effect change on injustices - are often unsure of, or do not analyse, the foundations for their decisions (p4).
Comment on Page 30, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The requirements of a theory of justice include bringing reason into play in the diagnosis of justice and injustice. Over hundreds of years,writers on justice in different parts of the world have attempted to provide the intellectual basis for moving from a general sense of injustice to particular reasoned diagnoses of injustice, and from thereto the analyses of ways of advancing justice. Traditions of reasoning about justice and injustice have long – and striking – histories across the world, from which illuminating suggestions on reasons of justice can be considered (as will be examined presently). {\&}quot;:
A central tenet of any theory of justice needs to be the application of reason (p5).

This approach, which can be called ‘transcendental institutionalism’, has two distinct features.First, it concentrates its attention on what it identifies as perfect justice,
Comment on Page 31, on highlighted text {\&}quot; rather than on relative comparisons of justice and injustice. It tries only to identify social characteristics that cannot be transcended in terms of justice, and its focus is thus not on comparing feasible societies, all of which may fall short of the ideals of perfection. The Inquiry is aimed at identifying the nature of ‘the just’, rather than finding some criteria for an alternative being ‘less unjust’ than another.Second, in searching for perfection, transcendental institutionalism concentrates primarily on getting the institutions right, and it is not directly focused on the actual societies that would ultimately emerge.The nature of the society that would result from any given set of institutions must, of course, depend also on non-institutional features,such as actual behaviours of people and their social interactions. In elaborating the likely consequences of the institutions, if and when a transcendental institutionalist theory goes into commenting on them,some specific behavioural assumptions are made that help the working of the chosen institutions.Both these features relate to the ‘contractarian’ mode of thinking that Thomas Hobbes had initiated, and which was further pursued by John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant.3A hypothetical ‘social contract’ that is assumed to be chosen is clearly concerned with an ideal alternative to the chaos that might otherwise characterize a society, and the contracts that were prominently dis-cussed by the authors dealt primarily with the choice of institutions.The overall result was to develop theories of justice that focused on transcendental identification of the ideal institutions.* {\&}quot;:
Sen identifies two distinct approaches to theories of justice: the first he calls 'transcendental institutionalism', and the second 'realisation-focused comparison'. The first follows in the footsteps of Thomas Hobbes, and focuses on an idea of perfect justice and explorations of 'the just', and avoids any sense of hierarchical justice. This approach largely overlooks matters of societal or individual outcomes resulting from this framework, but primarily focusing on institutional structures (pp5-6).
Comment on Page 32, on highlighted text {\&}quot; transcendental institutional investigation, but have also provided far-reaching analyses of the requirements of behavioural norms. Even though they have focused on institutional choices, their analyses can be seen, more broadly, as ‘arrangement-focused’ approaches to justice, with the arrangements including right behaviour by all as well as right institutions.* There is, obviously, a radical contrast between an arrangement-focused conception of justice and a realization-focused understanding: the latter must, for example,concentrate on the actual behaviour of people, rather than presuming compliance by all with ideal behaviour. {\&}quot;:
Some transcendental institutionalists discuss the imperative for social norms, with thorough philosophical exploration of moral and political imperatives for institutional choices (pp6-7).
Comment on Page 32, on highlighted text {\&}quot; social realizations (resulting from actual institutions, actual behaviour and other influences). {\&}quot;:
The second approach to justice focus on the reality of current institutions, behaviour and other such influences (p7). MY THOUGHTS - for me, the challenge is between these two approaches - it is how to get from where we are to where we want to go, from the reality of our current social state to an ideal sense of justice...
Comment on Page 32, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Even though these authors, with their very different ideas of the demands of justice, proposed quite distinct ways of making social comparisons, it can be said, at the risk of only a slight exaggeration,that they were all involved in comparisons of societies that already existed or could feasibly emerge, rather than confining their analyses to transcendental searches for a perfectly just society. Those focusing on realization-focused comparisons were often interested primarily in the removal of manifest injustice from the world that they saw. {\&}quot;:
Realization-focused theorists primarily focused on existing societies, or societies that could feasibly emerge, and the removal of injustices (p7).
Highlighted on Page 34: Importance must be attached to the starting point, in particular the selection of some questions to be answered (for example, ‘how would justice be advanced?’), rather than others (for example, ‘what would be perfectly just institutions?’). This departure has the dual effect,first, of taking the comparative rather than the transcendental route,and second, of focusing on actual realizations in the societies involved,rather than only on institutions and rules.

The central focus of any debate about justice, whether it be how justice is likely to manifest itself in terms of institutions or other entities, or perhaps the means to achieve a more just society, determines the route taken as well as the agents involved (p9).
Highlighted on Page 34: there may be no reasoned agreement at all, even under strict conditions of impartiality and open-minded scrutiny (for example, as identified by Rawls in his 'original position’) on the nature of the ‘just society’: this is the issue of the feasibility of finding an agreed transcendental solution.

Sen does not see it feasible to identify the nature of a 'just society' through the processes of 'impartiality and open-minded scrutiny' (p9). Additionally, identification of principles for achieving justice is particularly difficult if those are based on an abstract ideal of perfect justice, instead of those that are already available in the various existing societies (p9).
Highlighted on Page 34: an exercise of practical reason that involves an actual choice demands a framework for comparison of justice for choosing among the feasible alternatives and not an identification of a possibly unavailable perfect situation that could not be transcended: this is the issue of the redundancy of the search for a transcendental solution.

Comment on Page 43, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The need for an accomplishment-based understanding of justice is linked with the argument that justice cannot be indifferent to the lives that people can actually live. The importance of human lives, experiences and realizations cannot be supplanted by information about institutions that exist and the rules that operate. Institutions and rules are, of course, very important in influencing what happens, and they are part and parcel of the actual world as well, but the realized actuality goes well beyond the organizational picture, and includes the lives that people manage– or do not manage – to live. {\&}quot;:
Whilst institutions and rules provide a social framework, the actual lived experience can differ significantly, and is worthy of some discussion (p18).
Comment on Page 43, on highlighted text {\&}quot; The freedom to choose our lives can make a significant contribution to our well-being, but going beyond the perspective of well-being, the freedom itself may be seen as important. {\&}quot;:
Individual choice contributes to well-being, but the freedom itself is significant in our lived experience (p18).
Comment on Page 44, on highlighted text {\&}quot; if social realizations are assessed in terms of capabilities that people actually have, rather than in terms of their utilities or happiness (as Jeremy Bentham and other utilitarians recommend),then some very significant departures are brought about. First, human lives are then seen inclusively, taking note of the substantive freedoms that people enjoy, rather than ignoring everything other than the pleasures or utilities they end up having. There is also a second significant aspect of freedom: it makes us accountable for what we do. {\&}quot;:
Understanding individual freedoms and capabilities, rather than focusing on outcomes or realisations, provides a greater understanding of possibilities, and creates a sense of accountability for the paths that the individual has chosen (p19).
Comment on Page 44, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Freedom to choose gives us the opportunity to decide what we should do, but with that opportunity comes the responsibility for what we do – to the extent that they are chosen actions. Since a capability is the power to do something, the accountability that emanates from that ability – that power – is a part of the capability perspective, and this can make room for demands of duty – what can be broadly called deontological demands. There is an overlap here between agency-centred concerns and the implications of capability-based approach; but there is nothing immediately comparable in the utilitarian perspective (tying one’s responsibility to one’s own happiness).† The perspective of social realizations, including the actual capabilities that people can have, takes us inescapably to a large variety of further issues that turn out to be quite central to the analysis of justice in the world, and these will have to be examined and scrutinized. {\&}quot;:
With the freedom to choose, there are corresponding responsibilities for which the individual is accountable for the choices that are made (p19).
Comment on Page 45, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Consider Two different words –niti and nyaya– both of which stand for justice in classical Sanskrit. Among the principal uses of the term niti are organizational proprietary and behavioural correctness. In contrast with niti, the term nyaya stands for a comprehensive concept of realized justice. In that line of vision, the roles of institutions, rules and organization, important as they are, have to be assessed in the broader and more inclusive perspective of nyaya, which is inescapably linked with the world that actually emerges, not just the institutions or rules we happen to have.*To consider a particular application, early Indian legal theorists talked disparagingly of what they called matsyanyaya, ‘justice in the world of fish’, where a big fish can freely devour a small fish. We Are warned that avoiding matsyayaya must be an essential part of justice, and it is crucial to make sure that the ‘justice of fish’ is not allowed to invade the world of human beings. The central recognition here is that the realization of justice in the sense of nyaya is not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves. {\&}quot;:
Whilst the institutions are important for creating a system of just institutions and rules (niti), the reality of society can be considered independent in many ways (nyaya), and it needs to be part of the considerations (p20).
Comment on Page 46, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the subject of justice is not merely about trying to achieve – or dreaming about achieving – some perfectly just society or social arrangements, but about preventing manifestly severe injustice {\&}quot;:
Justice is the balance of striving to achieve an ideal justice, while simultaneously trying to prevent injustices (p21).
Comment on Page 49, on highlighted text {\&}quot; While that contrast may well fit broadly into the differentiation between the consequentialist and the deontological perspectives, what is particularly relevant here is to go beyond that simple contrast to examine what the totality of Arjuna’s concerns were about the prospect of his not faring well. Arjuna is not concerned only about the fact that, if the war were to occur, with him leading the charge on the side of justice and propriety, many people would get killed. That too,but Arjuna also expresses concern, in the early part of Gita itself, that he himself would inescapably be doing a lot of the killing, often of people for whom he has affection and with whom he has personal relations, in the battle between the two wings of the same family, in which others, well known to the two sides, had also joined. Indeed,the actual event that Arjuna worries about goes well beyond the process-independent view of consequences. An appropriate understanding of social realization – central to justice as nyaya– has to take the comprehensive form of a process-inclusive broad account.12 It would be hard to dismiss the perspective of social realizations on the grounds that it is narrowly consequentialist and ignores the reasoning underlying deontological concerns. {\&}quot;:
The importance of the process by which something is achieved cannot be overlooked because of the resulting outcome (p24).
Comment on Page 50, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Consider the strong dismissal of the relevance of ‘the idea of globaljustice’ by one of the most original, most powerful and most humanephilosophers of our time, my friend Thomas Nagel, from whose workI have learned so much. In a hugely engaging article inPhilosophyand Public Affairsin2005, he draws exactly on his transcendentalunderstanding of justice to conclude that global justice is not a viablesubject for discussion, since the elaborate institutional demandsneeded for a just world cannot be met at the global level at this time.As he puts it, ‘It seems to me very difficult to resist Hobbes’s claimabout the relation between justice and sovereignty’, and ‘if Hobbes isright, the idea of global justice without a world government is achimera’.13 {\&}quot;:
Philosophical arguments around the ideal of global justice suggest that the institutional requirements for implementing this just state of existence would be beyond current possibilities (p25).
Comment on Page 50, on highlighted text {\&}quot; In the global context, Nagel concentrates, therefore, on clarifying other demands, distinguishable from the demands of justice, such as ‘minimal humanitarian morality’ (which ‘governs our relation to all other persons’), and also to long-term strategies for radical change in institutional arrangements (‘I believe the most likely path toward some version of global justice is through the creation of patently unjust and illegitimate global structures of power that are tolerable to the interests of the most powerful current nation-states’).14 {\&}quot;:
Instead of pursuing an untenable notion of a just global governance, notions of 'minimal humanitarian morality' are suggested as a means for achieving justice through social norms (p25).},

Comment on Page 1, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Not long ago, the tasks these movements faced primarily involved working to achieve better treatment for women-a squarer deal. The concentration was mainly on women's well-being-and it was a much needed correc- tive. The objectives have, however, gradually evolved and broadened from this {\&}quot;welfarist{\&}quot; focus to incorporate-and emphasizethe ac- tive role of women's agency. {\&}quot;:
Previous women's movements have focused on women's well-being, however increasingly this focus is broadening to emphasise the importance of women's agency (p189).
Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; These different aspects (women's earning power, economic role outside the family, literacy and education, property rights and so on) may at first sight appear to be rather diverse and disparate. But what they all have in common is their positive contribution in adding force to women's voice and agency-through independence and empow-erment. {\&}quot;:
Whilst many inequalities experienced by women appear distinct and diverse - from income and property rights to education and literacy- they all contribute to the individuals empowerment and independence, resulting in greater agency and voice (p191).
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; the most useful way of understanding famines is in terms of the loss of entitlement-a sharp decline in the substantive freedom to buy food. This would lead to a collapse in the amount of food the family as a whole can buy and consume. While distributional problems within the family can be serious even in famine situations, they are par- ticularly crucial in determining the general undernourishment and hunger of different members of the family in situations of persistent poverty, which is {\&}quot;normal{\&}quot; in many communities. It is in the con- tinued inequality in the division of food-and (perhaps even more) that of health care-that gender inequality manifests itself most bla- tantly and persistently in poor societies with strong antifemale bias. {\&}quot;:
With the impact of gender inequality ranging from financial disparities to educational opportunities to things such as food distribution. These have a significantly greater impact with famines and other similar extreme conditions (p194).
Comment on Page 5, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Female literacy, in contrast, is found to have an unambiguous and statistically significant reducing impact on under-five mortality, even after controlling for male literacy. This is consistent with growing evidence of a close relationship between female literacy and child sur- vival in many countries in the world, and particularly in intercountry comparis{\~{}}ns.{\~{}}o In this case, the impact of greater empowerment and agency role of women is not reduced in effectiveness by problems arising from inflexible male participation in child care and household work. {\&}quot;:
Child survival rates are greatly influenced by female literacy levels and labour force participation, particularly impacting girl children, and whilst the burden of housework still largely rests on the women in the family, this doesn't seem to negatively impact this relationship (p197)
Comment on Page 7, on highlighted text {\&}quot; An interesting statistical finding in India relates to extensive interdistrict contrasts that show a strong-and statistically very significant-relation between the female-male ratio in the population and the scarcity of violent crimes. Indeed, the inverse connection between murder rates and the female-male ratio in the population has been observed by many researchers, and there have been alterna- tive explanations of the causal processes involved.25 Some have looked for causal explanations running from the incidence of vio- lent crimes leading to a greater preference for sons (taken to be bet- ter equipped to encounter a violent society), whereas others have seen it running from a larger presence of women (less inclined toward violence) to a consequently lower rate of crime.'6 There can also be some third factor that relates both to violent crime and to the male dominance of the sex ratio. There are many issues to be sorted out here, but the importance of gender and the influence of women's agency vis-b-vis men's are hard to overlook under any of the alterna- tive explanations. {\&}quot;:
Research comparing various districts throughout India demonstrate that a higher female to male ratio correlates to fewer violent crimes (p200).},

abstract = {While civic engagement provides a rich rationale for intervention, the array of discourses urging a focus on youth engagement or action means that the concept can be confusing, cluttered, and lacking consistent operationalization. From the perspective of policy-makers and program managers, it can be challenging to disentangle the competing messages and assumptions about young people that underpin the rhetoric in relation to youth engagement. Using a wide range of international research, the purpose of this paper is to provide clarity regarding the key multiple concepts and issues pertinent to the concept of youth civic engagement. In particular, the paper answers the following questions: what are the definitions, typologies, and discourses in which the concept of youth civic engagement operates, and what are the putative beneficial outcomes of youth engagement identified? We also discuss some of the broader considerations on the positioning of young people in society, which impact the trajectory of civic ...},
annote = {2014 Understanding youth civic engagement- debates, discourses, and lessons from practice.pdf
Highlighted on Page 4: The concept of civic engagement is closely related to that of active citizenship and/or participation and has been defined as{\&}quot;individual or collective actions in which people participate to improve the wellbeing of communities or society in general, and which provide opportunities for reflection{\&}quot; (Innovations in Civic Participation,2010, p. vi).
Highlighted on Page 4: Lister (2007) views civic engagement as an expression of young people as social actors and the contributions they already make in society or in their{\&}quot;practices as citizens.{\&}quot;For others, civic engagement is a {\&}quot;bedrock value of democracy,{\&}quot; defined as being able to influence choices in collective action (Camino {\&}amp; Zeldin,2002, p. 214). Zaff, Hart,Flanagan, Youniss, and Levine (2010) highlight that civic engagement includes the exercise of rights and responsibilities as well as some concern for the state and shared fate with one's fellow citizens.
Highlighted on Page 4: Amn{\~{A}}¥ (2012), civic engagement, in essence, has to do with a person being {\&}quot;outward looking,{\&}quot;and can be summed up as the{\&}quot;values, beliefs, attitudes, feelings, knowledge, skills and behaviours concerned with conditions outside of the immediate environment of family and friends{\&}quot;(p. 613). It finds expression, the author suggests, in various spheres including the public, market, civil, and personal. Current perspectives on civic engagement reflect{\&}quot;new social movements 'innovative ways of questioning and transforming conventional forms of politics and political participation{\&}quot;(ibid.), making the point that one does not need to be actively involved in political participation to be engaged civically.
Highlighted on Page 4: Innovations in Civic Participation (2010) in asset-mapping for youth civic engagement activities provides a useful grouping:(a) Community service and volunteering;(b) Mutual aid: support to others within the same community or social group;(c) Advocacy and campaigning: raising public consciousness, working to change legislation, and representation to government consultation bodies;(d) Youth media: forms of media production by young people;(e) Social entrepreneurship: creating innovative solutions to social problems; and
Highlighted on Page 5: (f) Leadership training and practice: mechanisms for learning and exercising leadership skills.
Highlighted on Page 5: youth civic engagement can be conceptualized as part of a continuum
Highlighted on Page 5: It is important to recognize how other forms of youth activity can complement it and build skills and confidence. At its core, however, civic engagement activity is characterized by agency on the part of young people, as well as collective action toward social change that is youth-led and directed.
Highlighted on Page 7: Democratic Citizen, views citizenship primarily in terms of how political and civic identity is activated through engagement and influence in the public sphere.
Highlighted on Page 7: The fundamental premise of this discourse is that the active involvement of individuals is important for society as it enhances the vibrancy of democracy. In fact, for a democracy to survive, its citizens must participate. From a societal point of view, it is argued that the participation of young people is important to ensure that the democratic process is inclusive, energized, and renewed. Flanagan and Levine (2010, p. 160) point out that during adolescence, young people{\&}quot;chart a course for their future and take stock of the values they live by and the world they want to be part of.{\&}quot;According to Finlay,Wray-Lake, and Flanagan (2010), there is considerable evidence that if civic engagement begins in adolescence, it can continue throughout the life course. Because of this, it is argued that civic attitudes, beliefs, and skills should be nurtured among young people.
Highlighted on Page 7: The youth participation literature, therefore, revolves largely around finding opportunities for youth to demonstrate their capacities to participate as political and social actors in society (Lister,2007)
Highlighted on Page 8: the United States, Flanagan and Levine (2010) highlight that young adults today are less likely than their counterparts in the 1970s to exhibit nine out of ten characteristics of citizen-ship: belonging to at least one group, attending religious services at least monthly,belonging to a union, reading newspapers at least once a week, voting, being contacted by a political party, working on a community project, attending club meetings, and believing that people are trustworthy. Volunteering is the only indicator that has seen an increase since the 1970s. These trends illustrate the need for policies to encourage political and civil engagement among young people.
Highlighted on Page 8: Some have argued that the perceived decline in youth civic engagement may be just a symptom of the fact that forms of civic engagement change from generation to generation (Sherrod, Flanagan, {\&}amp; Youniss,2002). 
Highlighted on Page 8: It appears that young people are more likely to engage in informal networks and online communities than to read mainstream newspapers or join political parties or trade unions (Sherrodet al.,2002). This perhaps reflects changing preferences for other, less organized, forms of participation, engagement, and expression (Stolle {\&}amp; Hooghe,2005). Harris, Wyn,and Younes (2011, p. 27) note that youth engage in many issues in more ordinary and sometimes individualized ways. The increased usage of social networking sites on the internet is recognized as a form of engagement for many youth who feel that they do not have a public space to engage with others. They have been described as{\&}quot;intimate,social, unregulated youth space{\&}quot;where{\&}quot;ordinary youth{\&}quot;can express themselves and have a say in the public sphere (ibid.). Likewise, Banaji (2008) illustrates that there area wide variety of online spaces with which youth engage with to varying degrees. The impact of online engagement on young people's civic engagement, particularly those aged 15 years and under, is far from definitive (Media Awareness Network,2011). There is some evidence to suggest that social networking sites are being woven into existing forms of engagement and have a positive impact on civic and political action for adults and older youth (over 18 years of age) (Gil de Z{\~{A}}º{\~{A}}±iga, Jung, {\&}amp; Valenzuela,2012;
Highlighted on Page 9: It also appears that youth are well versed at using this technology and have effectively deployed social media in mobilizing social change (e.g. the Arab Spring revolutions; see Lim,2012). Those already engaged in civic life prefer a blended approach of online and face-to-face interaction (Media Awareness Network,2011)
Highlighted on Page 9: Positive youth development. Within this discursive position, civic engagement activities are widely seen as a means of strengthening the development and capacities of young people. Skill and asset building approaches to working with young people stress the importance of encouraging the overall development of the young person rather than merely trying to{\&}quot;fix{\&}quot;their problems. The most high profile theoretical model is{\&}quot;positive youth development (PYD){\&}quot;which promotes the development of the young person through emphasis on five key personality characteristics, described as the five Cs: competence, confidence, character,connection, and caring (Lerner, Almerigi, Theokas, {\&}amp; Lerner,2005; Eccles {\&}amp; Gootman,2002). A sixth,{\&}quot;contribution,{\&}quot;emerges from the first five and is more likely to be seen in young people who contribute to their communities (Sherrod, Torney-Purta, {\&}amp; Flanagan,2010). It is argued that PYD can promote civic engagement, which in turn further promotes PYD. The main unit of analysis is the individual young person whose behavior and mindset can be strengthened and made more resourceful though involvement in community activities.
Highlighted on Page 9: Belonging/community connectedness. Against the backdrop of what is viewed as an increasingly individualized society (Beck,1992), we can find a discourse that perhaps sees civic engagement as a means to forge a sense of belonging among young people to something wider than their individual selves. This discourse stems from a desire to create stronger connections for youth toward others in the places they live and the spaces in which they interact.
Highlighted on Page 9: There are two key theoretical positions supporting this discourse: social capital and interactionist theory. The concept of social capital refers to the fact that social connections and trust between people are beneficial to individuals and to society (Field,2008;Portes,1998; Putnam,2000). Research has shown that community is important to adolescent well being by virtue of broadening networks and providing opportunities for interaction with others, often through local groups and activities. Furthermore, being known (by adults) matters to children for their sense of safety and being cared for.
Highlighted on Page 10: Leonard's(2005) research in Northern Ireland shows that young people can be civically active within local communities by providing favors to older neighbors.
Highlighted on Page 10: Civic engagement is thus viewed as the mechanism which develops trust, safety, support networks, and information - as constitutive ingredients of social capital - from which young people derive a greater sense of belonging or stake within society.
Highlighted on Page 10: Bridger, Brennan, and Luloff (2009) view community from an interactional perspective, where the emergence of community is a dynamic process of bringing people together. This perspective is particularly useful in explaining the process leading to civic engagement. All localities are composed of numerous distinct social fields or groups whose members act to achieve diverse individual interests and goals. Connecting these individual fields is the{\&}quot;community field{\&}quot;which serves to coordinate and unite individual groups into purposive community wide efforts. It cuts across class lines, organized groups, and other entities within a local population by focusing on the general and com-mon needs of all residents. Through this interactive process, an entity can emerge that is far greater than the sum of its parts.
Highlighted on Page 10: The key component to this process is found in the creation and maintenance of channels of interaction and communication among the diverse local groups that would otherwise be directed toward their more individual interests. Through these relationships, individuals interact with one another, and begin to mutually understand general common needs. As residents and groups interact over issues important to all of them,what has come to be known as community agency, or the capacity for local action and resiliency, emerges (Brennan {\&}amp; Luloff,2007). Agency reflects the building of local rela-tionships that increase the adaptive capacity of local people within a common territory.Agency can therefore be seen as the capacity of people to manage, utilize, and enhancethose resources available to them in addressing locality wide issues (Brennan, Luloff, {\&}amp;Ricketts,2007). The application of agency can be seen in civic engagement at all levels.
Highlighted on Page 10: While the attention given to building local capacities is often focused toward aggregates of adult residents, youth are increasingly visible and active contributors toward community development efforts. Such involvement assists with both the development of community and with the social and psychological development of the youth within it.These active youth represent the future leaders and activists that will help shape local life and wellbeing in the years to come. The merging of such community and youth development theory can help us to better conceptualize how both might mutually contribute to their sustainability (Barnett {\&}amp; Brennan,2006).
Highlighted on Page 10: A fourth discourse might see civic engagement as a means of addressing the needs of young people, particularly those who are vulnerable. Whereas the PYD discourse applies to all young people, the care discourse is of relevance to young people who experience challenges, such as poverty, health issues, disability, and exploitation. Proponents of this approach believe that all youth need to be challenged as well as cared for and that civic engagement offers the means to do both simultaneously (Dolan,2010;Pittman, Irby, Tolman, Yohalem, {\&}amp; Ferber,2003, p. 14).
Highlighted on Page 11: Dolan (2010) argues that civic engagement and democratic participation can represent a means by which young people can enhance their resilience and social support.The study of resilience focuses on how some individuals, in spite of exposure to a series of adverse experiences in the early years, manage to escape any serious harm (Coleman {\&}amp; Hendry,1999). Longitudinal studies of risk and resilience have shown that many young people, who despite being exposed to serious risks during childhood, cope welland demonstrate positive outcomes in adulthood. These studies have attributed resilience to the presence of protective factors that help to mitigate against the effects of early disadvantage. Significant protective factors include intelligence and problem-solving skills,external interests or attachments, support from non-familial adults, a defined purpose in life, and sense of self-efficacy (Ungar,2008). Similarly, studies in the social support tra-dition found that those who participated in their community and the larger society had better mental health status than more isolated people (Cohen {\&}amp; Willis,1985). Dolan(2010) argues that youth civic engagement provides opportunities for young people to develop mutually supportive relationships with others and to experience how it feels to make a difference to society. In this way, he contends, social or political civic activity by youth has the potential to buffer them from the adverse effects of difficult life cir-cumstances - in other words, to help them to become resilient (Dolan,2010).
Highlighted on Page 11: Social justice. While the focus on youth as assets is core to the PYD field, emerging work takes into account the need for civic orientation of groups who have been marginalized from society. Flanagan and Christens (2011, p. 3) argue that class and racial divides in the civic opportunities available to young people are evident in realities such as the lack of opportunities to practice civic skills, disassociation from school, and time constraints of living in economically disadvantaged communities. In addition, the authors point out,traits such as confidence and optimism can predispose some young people to become engaged in civic action, factors that can be impacted by social class and background.
Highlighted on Page 11: Social justice youth development is a form of engaging young people that incorporates a distinct political or social change objective. It is distinct from other kinds of youth development in that it calls for an explicit acknowledgment of the seriousness oft he socioeconomic challenges facing young people. Social justice models include elements of youth development frameworks such as emotional and social support, positive adult relationships and so on, yet encompass sociopolitical elements based on critical understanding about the root causes of social and community problems. According to Ginwright and Cammarota (2002, p. 86), as an intervention for youth, justice-informed frameworks{\&}quot;go beyond assets-based and pro-social development to foster youth as active agents of change in their own environment based on understanding of sociopolitical conditions and injustice.{\&}quot;The fostering of{\&}quot;critical consciousness{\&}quot;that develops young people through the provision of specific sociopolitical competencies is reflected in developing capacity to articulate social and community problems as well as propose solutions. Ginwright and Cammarota propose a social justice model for youth develop-ment based on two underlying principles of self-awareness/identity and social aware-ness.Self-awarenessincludes practices and programs that foster a positive sense of selfand explorations of racial, ethnic, and sexual identity.Social awarenessencourages peo-ple to think critically about issues in their own communities. It incorporates heightened knowledge of social issues coupled with skills that promote inquiry, analysis, and problem-solving.
Highlighted on Page 12: Benefits to individuals. At the micro-individual level, the literature points to a broad range of psychosocial and physical benefits to young people from civic engagement including: positive identity and development; enhanced self-confidence and self-esteem; improved social, communication, and critical thinking skills; greater educational/academic achievements and career aspirations; lower risk of addiction and problematic behaviors; good physical health;and heightened civic and service interest
Highlighted on Page 13: outcomes of youth involvement in community-based activities in terms of positive identity development and sense of identity (Pancer {\&}amp; Pratt, 1999; Pratt, Hunsberger, Pancer, {\&}amp; Alisat, 2003; Taylor {\&}amp; Pancer, 2007; Youniss, McLellan {\&}amp; Mazer, 2001; Youniss, McLellan, {\&}amp; Yates,1997; Youniss, McLellan, Su, {\&}amp; Yates,1999; Youniss {\&}amp; Yates,1999). This involvement has been linked to thriving during adolescence (Lerner et al.,2005; Theokas et al.,2005). More generally, such benefits are inline with the{\&}quot;six Cs{\&}quot;framework for PYD comprising growth in and positive levels of:competence, connection, character, confidence, caring, and contribution, which have been associated with prosocial involvement by youth (Busseri, Rose-Krasnor,Willoughby, {\&}amp; Chalmers,2006).
Highlighted on Page 13: Aiding others can bring great satisfaction and helps people to feel part of something bigger than themselves (Sherrod et al.,2002).
Highlighted on Page 13: Young people may enjoy increased independence and capacity to be altruistic, enabling them to direct their focus from their own problems to the needs of others, thereby being perceived as{\&}quot;civic actors{\&}quot;concerned with and taking responsibility for the health and well-being of all citizens(Flanagan et al.,1999). Involvement in service can engender feelings of self-efficacy(Kendrick,1996) and sense of making a difference in the lives of others, namely from having some form of responsibility or leadership through working in a coordinated fashion in a community-based organization (Henderson, Brown, Pancer, {\&}amp; Kimberly,2007).Young people can also benefit from better enlisted social support to and from others which has a known connection to better well-being and mental health (Dolan,2010). Moreover, the participation of youth in community life is particularly timely as it is at this stage in one's life that a sense of community and social responsibility is first formed(Pancer {\&}amp; Pratt, 1999). This involves developing an interest in the common good and support for the rights and needs of others. Also important is the role of identity formation in volunteering (Grube {\&}amp; Piliavin,2000; Lee, Piliavin, {\&}amp; Call,1999) whereby a volunteer identity is formed and developed as individuals engage in service work, which in turn influences their attitudes and intentions with respect to the amount of time they will spend volunteering and their commitment to future voluntary service work(Henderson et al.,2007; Taylor {\&}amp; Pancer,2007).
Highlighted on Page 13: Furthermore, there is much discussion in the literature in relation to the broad range of skills which young people may develop and/or enhance through civic engagement activity ranging from personal and social skills (Lewis,1991; Roker, Player, {\&}amp; Coleman,1998; Rubin, Bommer, {\&}amp; Baldwin,2002), to leadership (Kuh,1995), commu-nication (Tucker {\&}amp; McCarthy,2001), and critical thinking skills (Gellin,2003). Civic participation in service and voluntary work has also been associated with lower rates of dropout from the educational system (Mahoney,2000), higher academic achievement levels (Barber, Eccles, {\&}amp; Stone,2001; Eccles {\&}amp; Barber, 1999; Markus, Howard, {\&}amp; King,1993; Reeb, Sammon, {\&}amp; Isackson,1999), and a greater sense of career direction and progression (Johnson, Beebe, Mortimer, {\&}amp; Snyder,1998; Primavera, 1999; Taylor {\&}amp; Pancer,2007). Another positive outcome of youth engagement is a reduction in problem behaviors (Eccles {\&}amp; Barber,1999; Youniss {\&}amp; Yates,1999) including alcohol consumption and criminal involvement.

abstract = {Abstract: In this chapter, the author examines youth civic engagement in the light of the Positive Youth Development paradigm, exemplified by Search Institute's 40 Developmental Assets. Research on community service demonstrates how asset-building communities promote youth civic participation, and how young people's participation, in turn, contributes to the building of community assets. Organized youth activities, such as service-learning, are the critical vehicles that allow youth to participate and contribute, which leads to increased adult civic engagement. - See more at: https://gsn.nylc.org/links/1948{\#}sthash.rmG85VgA.dpuf},

Highlighted on Page 1: This PYD approach is also attractive for several theoretical reasons. First, its focus onpositive development instead of risks or deficiencies is its overarching contribution.This view reasons that all young people have needs; youth differ not in individualqualities such as resiliency but in the extent to which their needs are met by theresources in their environment. The research and policy focus is shifted from solelyfocusing on individual qualities and from preventing negative behaviors to focusingon deficiencies in the environment and to promoting positive outcomes. It alsotends toward universal policies, as the target is all youth, not just “those at risk.”Second, this approach focuses on the whole individual, viewing socioemotional
Highlighted on Page 2: development as equal in importance to cognitive development. This holistic viewis best reflected in the five C’s: competence, confidence, character, connection, andcaring; a sixth C, contribution, has also been identified as resulting from the firstfive (Lerner, 2004).
Highlighted on Page 2: Third, attention to the multiple influences on development, asdescribed by Bronfenbrenner (1979, 1998), promotes a diversity of approaches toresearch and policy. There is not one policy solution needed to promote youthdevelopment. The PYD approach emphasizes how comprehensive our approach mustbe; it is not sufficient to attend just to families, school, or neighborhoods. Fourth,it conceives of the individual as a dynamic organism that acts and is influencedby those actions. It emphasizes the bidirectional interaction between organismand environments. In this way, the individual becomes a producer of their owndevelopment. This indicates the importance of early and lasting interventions tocreate contexts in which children and youth thrive. Fifth, a focus on multipleinfluences indicates the need for a multidisciplinary approach. This is particularlyattractive for research but it also means that anthropologists and psychologists areas important to policy making as economists and sociologists. Finally, the PYDapproach also emphasizes the importance of cultural and transnational comparisons.Globalization and media access open up new worlds to youth all over the world(Arnett, 2001). Both research and policy must attend to this expansion of the contextfor youth development.
Highlighted on Page 13: Young people have a tremendous contribution to make to their families, theircommunities, and their societies.

These motivationsin turn relate to the components of citizenship we de-scribed: a concern for others, a commitment to somegroup larger than oneself, and actual political engage-ment.

Highlighted on Page 2: In fact,this volume evolved out of disagreement among schol-ars about those behaviors that constitute citizenship.For the past 2 years, we three along with a largergroup of scholars have been meeting as a consortium
Highlighted on Page 2: on youth civic development, funded by the William T.Grant Foundation. The consortium has multiple func-tions, but at the first meeting of this group in February2001, much of the discussion focused on the issue ofdefining citizenship. Although our meeting began withan assumption of a shared understanding, we soon dis-covered that there was substantial disagreement in thegroup on what constituted citizenship.
Highlighted on Page 3: Political scien-tists are concerned that new generations gain the skillsthat enable them to be informed citizens and learn thatthey have a right and a responsibility to hold elected of-ficials accountable. At times they even worry that pro-grams such as community service may become a sub-stitute rather than a complement to electoral politics asan arena for civic action (see Walker, this issue).

Highlighted on Page 3: developmentalists note that governmentand elections may feel too distant from the everydaylives of youth and that young people also need opportu-nities to affiliate, commit, and to feel responsible togroups larger than themselves. It is this collective iden-tity that is a precursor to conceiving of oneself as a citi-zen, as a member of the public, and as someone whowould be interested in the decisions of elected officials.
Highlighted on Page 3: if you ask youth, they willdefinecitizenshipas good behavior, doing what youare expected to do, obeying laws, and so on (Conover{\&}amp; Searing, 2000; Flanagan {\&}amp; Faison, 2001; Sherrod,2002a);
Highlighted on Page 3: In fact, this “lowest common denominator” notionof citizenship also pervades some of the literature oncharacter education.
Highlighted on Page 4: Torney-Purta (Torney-Purta, Lehmann,Oswald, {\&}amp; Schultz, 2001, and this issue) and Conoverand Searing (2000) reported that young people havelimited understanding here. This may be the reasonthey view good citizenship to be isomorphic with goodbehavior.
Highlighted on Page 4: We know from research on per-spective taking that the ability to appreciate another’sperspective gradually increases during the adolescentyears (Selman, 1980). However, although adolescentsappear to learn a lot about reciprocity in peer relation-ships, these are typically with friends who share theirvalues (Berndt, 1982). It is not until late adolescence thatthey learn to integrate and resolve different points ofview (Selman, 1980), which may be an artefact ofage-grading trends and the homogenization of adoles-cents’ experience in the United States. If the ability tolisten to others who have different experiences and opin-ions from oneself, to appreciate difference and respectthose differences, and to learn to compromise are skillsof citizens in a diverse democracy (Conover {\&}amp; Searing,2000; Flanagan {\&}amp; Faison, 2001), then more research isneeded to uncover ways to maximize such opportunitiesin the settings of youth development.
Highlighted on Page 4: Clearly for a democracy to survive, its citizens mustparticipate. Nations certainly need to socialize theircitizens into politics, so it is perfectly understandablethat an argument such as that proposed by Putnam(1996, 2000), that civic engagement is at an all-timelow, would raise national concern and debate(McLeod, 2000; Peiser, 2000; Youniss {\&}amp; Yates, 1997).A democracy cannot survive without the participationof its citizens (Galston, 2001; Rahn, 1997).

Highlighted on Page 4: We know that one of the key ingredients of suc-cessful community-based youth development programsis young people’s feeling that they matter and have avoice in determining programs (Eccles {\&}amp; Gootman,2002). We also know that adults are more likely to voteand be engaged in the civic affairs of their communitiesif they were involved as youth in community-based or-ganizations or extracurricular activities (Verba,Scholzman, {\&}amp; Brady, 1995; Youniss, McClellan, {\&}amp;Yates, 1997).
Highlighted on Page 6: There has however been little explora-tion of the developmental precursors necessary formature political engagement. Moral reasoning and itsrelation to cognitive development has been studied(Colby, Kohlberg, Gibbs, {\&}amp; Lieberman, 1983; Damon,1988). Verbogt (1996) found that the level of moralreasoning was positively related to sociocultural liber-alism or open-mindedness and tolerance toward life-style and cultural differences, but had no relation to in-dividual’s attitudes toward economic policies ordistributive justice issues. Hence, the relation betweendevelopmental competencies and civic engagementmay be more complex than a straightforward posses-sion of the ability or not
Highlighted on Page 6: there is growing evidence that personal-ity seems to coalesce during the young adult years, sothat one’s personal style is not stable till about 30 yearsof age (Costa {\&}amp; McCrae, 1994). The relation betweenpersonality and political involvement has not seriouslybeen studied. But clearly the development of identity,which is related to personality, carries implications forpolitical attitudes and behaviors.

Highlighted on Page 7: However, it is clear that high school civics educa-tion alone cannot develop the civic engagement of ouryouth. Youth need knowledge. Hopefully, knowledgeshould guide much of our behavior. However, we al-ready know in the area of prevention of high-risk sex-ual behavior that knowledge alone is not sufficient tochange behavior (DiClemente, 1993). This is likely tobe equally true for political behavior. Youth also needsome motivation to behave, and this is where thewhyenters, or what do they get out of it. 
Highlighted on Page 7: In countries such as theUnited States, there is not only a large gap in civicknowledge between students who have high literacyand educational resources at home and those who donot, but also a gap in their expressed interest in votingas adults. 
Highlighted on Page 7: In focus groups on politics with disadvan-taged urban youth, we find that they even more thanother youth conceptualize citizenship in terms of sim-ply obeying the law. However, for youth who are likelyto break the law and end up in prison (Roach, Sullivan,{\&}amp; Wheeler, 1999), obeying the lawisthe first and mostimportant way for them to show good citizenship.Hence, for these youth, this may be where we begin.
Highlighted on Page 7: Immigrants are the one group in a diverse populationthat seem to hold views promoting civic engagement.They may come to this country because of economicreasons and may have some divided loyalty between thiscountry and their country of origin, but they do not feelmarginalized nor alienated as do involuntary minorities(Conover {\&}amp; Searing, 2000; Ogbu, 1991).

However, it shouldinclude components relating to moving beyond self-inter-est, expressing some concern for others. It should involvesome sense of connectedness to some group other thanone’s self; the nation is one such group. Tolerance shouldalso be a component. Some understanding of the rightsand responsibilities of a citizen in a democracy is an as-pect. Even if cynical about politics, the person must un-derstand how their action or inaction contributes to thenation state of which we all are members. Continuing re-search needs to explore the multifaceted components ofcitizenship, how they develop individually and in interac-tion, and how different experiences contribute to the de-velopment of different components.

The emphasis on community development allows the individuals themselves to shape their needs and action. Community development has two primary goals, to improve quality of life and to involve all people in the change process
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; In order for individuals and communities to become the protagonists for their own development, they must have the capacity to define, analyse and meet their own needs. The ability of a group to participate in its own development requires a wide range of capacities: namely, inclusive decision-making, ability to resolve conflicts and think systematically, and to understand problems and seek solutions (Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity 2008). In essence, it requires the full participation of all community members, based on the recognition that all have something worthwhile to contribute. Thus, community-based capacity building is both a prerequisite and an outcome of community development. {\&}quot;:
The capacity to identify, analyse and provide for their own needs are pre-requisites to individuals becoming protagonists in their own development. However for the development of groups and communities, other capabilities also need to exist, inter alia, decision making, conflict resolution, systematic thinking, and the ability to understand problems and seek effective solutions (Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity 2008, p7).

The emphasis on community development allows the individuals themselves to shape their needs and action. Community development has two primary goals, to improve quality of life and to involve all people in the change process {\&}quot;:
Community development has a two-fold purpose: to improve the quality of life for individuals and engage all individuals in the process of change. It seeks to improve the lot of individuals within a certain region; it does this through participation, voluntary cooperation and self-sustaining efforts. This focus allows individuals to identify both their needs and the actions required for actualisation (Singh et al. 2014, p44).

Comment on Page 10, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Although the basic principles of capacity building for community development are universal, the issues being identified and addressed are contextual. There is no community that can claim to be ‘developed’. All communities are on a continuum of development, with its inherent challenges. Such challenging issues might in-clude: family breakdown, mental illness and stress, drugs and alcohol, food securi-ty, equality of the sexes, education, poverty or ill-health, and land issues. {\&}quot;:
Understanding development as a continuum identifies that no community is 'developed'. Issues of development often identified can include food security, land rights, family breakdown, mental illness, drugs and alcohol, gender equality, education, and poverty and ill health (p50).
Highlighted on Page 10: According to the International Development Research Council, when development is looked at as ‘change that improves the conditions of human well-being so that people can exercise meaningful choices for their own benefit and that of society’ it places people at the centre of the process (Ryan 1995, p. v).

{\&}quot;By running up all the different virtues to this one species of propriety, Epicurus indulged a propensity, which is natural to all men, but which philosophers in particular are apt to cultivate with a peculiar fondness, as the great means of displaying their ingenuity, the propensity to account for all appearances from as few principles as possible. And he, no doubt, indulged this propensity still further, when he referred all the primary objects of natural desire and aversion to the pleasures and pains of the body.{\&}quot;

Parental involvement in a young person's life, youth religious involvement, and voluntary association participation were some of the forms of social capital hypothesized to influence adult political behavior. Structural equations modeling was used to trace the effects of the presence of social capital as early as the 8th grade year in shaping young adult political and civic behavior. The analysis shows that early extensive connections to others, close familial relationships, religious participation, and participation in extracurricular activities in one's youth are significant predictors of greater political and civic involvement in young adulthood.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine different facets of trust in the political system or civic realm and how they are correlated to the expected civic or political engagement of young people. The nature and effects of trust in social and political institutions have been studied in adults, distinguishing between various types of trust (in institutions compared with more generalized trust in people). Few studies have focused on how trust affects the political socialization of children and adolescents, who are in the process of developing their attitudes towards government and other social institutions. Our analysis uses data collected in 1999 from the IEA Civic Education Study of 14-year-olds to examine trust at three levels—trust in institutions with which individuals have little or no daily contact (those delegated as representatives in institutions such as the national legislature), trust in institutions with whose representatives individuals interact frequently (schools), and trust in other people. First in this analysis, levels of these three types of trust are compared in five democracies whose levels of political stability vary (Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, England and the United States). Second, correlates of individuals’ levels of trust (including school climate and experiences with family) are examined. Third, trust, civic knowledge, school experiences, and family variables are used to predict levels of three types of civic or political engagement (voting, conventional political participation that goes beyond voting, and community participation). Levels of trust relate to the stability of democracy in the countries examined and to participation, suggesting a “threshold” of trustworthiness which a political system needs to establish in order to foster civic and political participation in young people. Additionally, different types of civic engagement are influenced differentially by trust and by other aspects of experience in schools. Civic knowledge is a predictor of the expectation of voting (and obtaining information about candidates), but it is not related to the expectation of civic participation in the community (through volunteering or collecting for charity). Service learning experiences show small positive effects on expectations of voting and larger effects on expectations of civic participation in the community (especially in the United States).},

abstract = {The report, Youth Civic Participation in Action: Meeting Community and Youth Development Needs Worldwide, builds on information ICP has gathered over the years from previous participants of the International Association for National Youth Service global conferences, from partners throughout the world and as part of various ICP projects. The snapshots are not intended to be comprehensive, but instead provide a brief glimpse into how youth civic participation is taking shape in various countries. The publication highlights the growing international movement in which more and more countries are supporting youth and community development by expanding youth civic participation opportunities. Programs for civic participation can take many forms and work best when adapted to the needs and resources in the local community. As a result, the snapshots in this publication describe programs ranging from intensive, highly-structured, government programs to infrequent volunteering with community-based organizations; from service-learning integrated into primary, secondary and university curricula to young people creating their own organizations to engage others in addressing issues that matter most to them. This report demonstrates that young people worldwide are active in addressing the needs of their communities through service including medical students meeting health needs in rural areas in Latin America, young people supporting disaster relief efforts in Asia, service programs bolstering social services as an alternative to conscription in Europe, peer mentoring to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa and young people sparking grassroots campaigns for community development in the Middle East. Throughout the world, young people are building their skills while meeting critical community needs through service. To learn more about these efforts, please browse through the snapshots on the publication website or view the full report.

abstract = {People's participation is becoming the central issue of our time. The democratic transition in many developing countries, the collapse of many socialist regimes, and the worldwide emergence of people's organizations- these are all part of a historic change, not just isolated events. People today have an urge-an impatient urge-to participate in the events and processes that shape their lives. And that impatience brings many dangers and opportunities. It can dissolve into anarchy, ethnic violence or social disintegration. But if properly nurtured in a responsive national and global framework, it can also become a source of tremendous vitality and innovation for the creation of new and more just societies. The dangers arise as the irresistible urge for participation clashes with inflexible systems. Although the achievements in human development have been significant during the past three decades, the reality is continuing exclusion. More than a billion of the world's people still languish in absolute poverty, and the poorest fifth find that the richest fifth enjoy more than 150 times their income. Women still earn only half as much as men-and despite constituting more than half the votes, have great difficulty securing even 10{\%} representation in parliaments. Rural people in developing countries still receive less than half the income opportunities and social services available to their urban counterparts. Many ethnic minorities still live like a separate nation within their own countries. And political and economic democracy is still a reluctant process in several countries.

Highlighted on Page 1: In contrast to the common view that adolescents are increasingly disengaged from society and civic issues (e.g.,Bennett,2000; Cook, 2004; Harris, Wyn, {\&}amp; Younes, 2010), recent studies suggest that many adolescents do try to contribute to society. The ways by which theydothis, however, have developed from mainly traditional forms,such as being a member of a political party or voting for elections (e.g.,Zukin, Keeter, Andolina, Jenkins, {\&}amp; Delli Carpini, 2006), to also newer forms of engagement,such as signing petitions, demonstrating, boycotting products, and expressing one{\^{a}}€™s opinions through new media such as interactive websites (e.g.,Coleman {\&}amp; Rowe, 2005; Flanagan, Levine, {\&}amp; Settersten, 2009). Adolescent engagement is a topic of major public interest as it not only contributes to society, but also positively stimulates adolescents {\^{a}}€™own development. It promotes, for example, adolescents {\^{a}}€™life-satisfaction, self-rated health, self-esteem,educational and occupational achievement, sense of agency, social relatedness, and their moral-political awareness (e.g.,Youniss {\&}amp; Yates, 1999; Wilson, 2000). As adolescent engagement is considered important and is stimulated by the government, schools and educators, it is important to gain more insight into the factors associated with adolescent engagement.Knowledge about these factors may provide tools to current initiatives stimulating adolescent engagement.
Highlighted on Page 2: Morality and identity are important, relatively stable predictors of concurrent and future volunteering (e.g.,Grube {\&}amp; Piliavin, 2000; Matsuba, Hart, {\&}amp; Atkins, 2007; McLellan {\&}amp; Youniss, 2003
Highlighted on Page 2: some theorists have described how morality and identity together can influence volunteering behaviour (for an overview seeBergman, 2002)
Highlighted on Page 2: Moral reasoning, moral thought and volunteering. Over the last decades, research on the relation between morality and volunteering behaviour has mainly emphasized the role of moral reasoning(Kohlberg{\&}amp; Candee,1984;Walker, 2004).Moralreasoning can be defined as {\^{a}}€{\oe}a psychological construct that characterizes the process by which people determine that one course of action in a particular situation is morally right and another course of action is wrong {\^{a}}€(Rest, Thoma, {\&}amp; Edwards,1997). Moral reasoning is distinguished from other forms of reasoning, such as conventional reasoning (reasoning on relatively arbitrary rules and regulations that structure social interactions in social systems), as it concerns issues that inherently have consequence for other {\^{a}}€™s welfare and rights (Yau {\&}amp;Smetana, 2003; Nucci,1996).Kohlbergian theorists argue that moral reasoning as an inner psychological process, can give riseto outwardly observable behaviour, such as volunteering (Rest, Narvaez, Bebeau, {\&}amp; Thoma, 1999). They argue that a higher level of moral reasoning leads to a stronger motivation to act accordingly to one{\^{a}}€™s moral principles. Next to that it has been shown that volunteering can be experienced as a moral act as it directly affects the welfare of others (Metzger {\&}amp; Smetana,2009). We therefore hypothesized that a higher level of moral reasoning could also be related to (being) more (inclined to show) volunteering behaviour (e.g.,Eisenberg, Carlo, Murphy, {\&}amp; Van Court,1995; Kohlberg {\&}amp; Candee,1984). However, overall,only small to moderate relations have been found between moral reasoning and prosocial behaviours such as volunteering(e.g.,Eisenberg, 1982; Eisenberg et al., 1995; Hardy, 2006).
Highlighted on Page 2: Moral commitment represents the motivational element of general moral thought. It refers to the extent to which one feels personally responsible for and committed to moral rights issues (cf.Blasi, 1983, 1995; moral motivation,Rest, Bebeau et al.,1999; Raaijmakers {\&}amp; van Hoof, 2006). The fact that general moral thought contains both a cognitive as well as a motivational element, the latter being an important predictor of actual behaviour (Chapman {\&}amp; Morley,1999; Clary et al.,1998), may be an additional reason to expect that general moral thought is more close to volunteering than moral reasoning.
Highlighted on Page 2: Moral reasoning refers to the level of reasoning given a hypothetical moral dilemma concerning abstract categories (such as justice, duty, and rights;Narvaez, Getz, Rest, {\&}amp; Thoma, 1999). It may therefore not show direct, strong associations with specific real life (moral) behaviour such as volunteering (cf.Higgins-D{\^{a}}€™Alessandro, 2008; Boom {\&}amp; Brugman, 2005). Moral theorists and researchers therefore argue that additional concepts are also important in volunteering (e.g., moral motivation;Rest, Bebeau et al.,1999) or that intermediate (moral) concepts concerning actual issues instead of hypothetical dilemma{\^{a}}€™s aremore close to - and therefore more important for - adolescents {\^{a}}€™volunteering (e.g.,Blasi, 1983, 1995; Narvaez et al., 1999).

Highlighted on Page 8: We found that a higher level of moral reasoning was positively associated with the cognitive elements of adolescents {\^{a}}€™general moral thought: It was related to a better understanding for actual, real life moral issues (moral understanding) and to being more able to think about the collective, moral responsibility for these issues (moral referral;Derryberry {\&}amp; Thoma; 2005;Narvaez et al., 1999; Pitt {\&}amp; Thoma, 2005; Rest, Thoma et al., 1999).
Highlighted on Page 8: with age,adolescents developed a higher level of moral reasoning (cf.Eisenberget al., 2005; e.g.,Rest,1979)and adolescents were more likely to volunteer (e.g.,Metz {\&}amp; Youniss, 2003). However, when they did volunteer, they were not more involved in volunteering activities than younger adolescents (e.g.,Cheung, 2006). This suggests that although age plays a role in starting volunteering work, other factors are important in predicting how often adolescents will perform volunteering activities.
Highlighted on Page 9: Former research has shown that girls volunteer more often in the company of friends and seek peer-approval by volunteering, in which case the volunteering behaviour could become part of who they are among their friends and peers. In contrast, boys seek out their own volunteering opportunities more often, in which case volunteering may be considered as a new identity context or experience (cf.Sundeen {\&}amp; Raskoff, 1995; Wuthnow, 1995).},

abstract = {A sense of being the same person through time and social contexts is a central characteristic of identity formation. The spatial integration of identity was investigated in three groups of high school students differing in age (early vs late adolescence) and/or educational level (low vs high). The 294 adolescents (aged 12-21 yrs) chose and ranked personally revealing identity contexts, described their general and context-specific identities, and indicated their subjective sense of well-being. With increasing age and educational level adolescents chose an increasing number of identity contexts. Context-specific identities were found on average to be closely interwoven. There was a positive linear relationship between spatial integration and subjective well-being. The conclusion is that age and education promote the extension of adolescents' identity horizons, provided that their spatial integration is solid enough to absorb the downward effect of a new identity context. A comparison between spatial integration and two measures of exploration and commitment showed that spatial integration is a relatively powerful measure of adolescent identity.

Comment on Page 2, on highlighted text {\&}quot; In our view, youth studies research frequently suffers from either problems ofomission, in which the politically repressive aspects of certain types of analysis arenot adequately acknowledged, or problems of conflation, in which for example atheoretical model premised upon ’free’ agency is fused with a political view whichsees young people as far more powerful as social actors than they really are. {\&}quot;:
Research looking at youth can often combine concepts of agency and youth as social actors, inflating actual capabilities as powerful social contributors (White {\&}amp;amp; Wyn 1998, p315).
Highlighted on Page 3: The achievement of greater agency, however, is predicated upon a clear conceptionof the different dimensions of agency and how these are shaped by larger institu-tional and historical forces. 
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Ironically, when thistype of agency is broached by youth studies it very often takes the form ofemphasising the almost absolute lack of agency of young people. There is a formof youth ’victimology’, for example, which defines young people primarily andexclusively in terms of their status as (passive) victims of circumstance (such ashomelessness, unemployment or poverty). The task of the analyst and activist isthus to act ’on behalf’ of the agentless youth. {\&}quot;:
When agency is assumed to be lacking, advocates will often assume agency and act 'on behalf' of the individual (White {\&}amp;amp; Wyn 1989, p317).
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot; A third sense in which we can talk about agency is wh’ere there is a collectiveproject which actively seeks to render their initiators and participants the authorsof their collective mode of existence as a whole ’in a conscious program aimed atcreating or remodelling whole social structures’ (Anderson 1980: 20). This is,literally, a revolutionary approach to agency, in the sense that it involves a con-scious, self-reflective practice which is tied to wider political ideals and utopi-anism of some kind (see Cooper and White 1994). Direct action and immediatesocial practice are strategically linked to a larger social change agenda of somekind. This is perhaps best seen in the contemporary time period in some sectionsof the new social movements (such as the feminist, green, and gay and lesbianmovements), as well as in reactionary social formations (such as neo-nazi andwhite supremacy movements). Here it is clear that there are significant limitationswith regard to youth action, insofar as relatively few young people are directlyengaged in social transformation activity of this kind. Further to this, it isimportant to distinguish activities and groups according to specific ideologicalorientations, not all of which are emancipatory in nature. In other words, analysisof engagement in collective action for social change also demands analysis of thepolitical configuration of such action. {\&}quot;:
Within collective action, agency is increasingly being seen as an avenue of youth involvement. Despite relatively few youth actively engaged in such initiatives, these groups embody conscious and self-reflective practices aimed at changing social norms and structures (White {\&}amp;amp; Wyn 1998, p317).
Comment on Page 4, on highlighted text {\&}quot;  we wish to demonstratehow the deterministic perspective tends to deny agency (by universalising youthexperience according to fixed stages and attributes), how the voluntaristic per-spective over-states agency (by downplaying the impact of social structural rela-tionships on young people’s choices and behaviour), and how the contextualperspective attempts to conceptualise agency as specific kinds of social practicewhich take place within certain social structural parameters (by grounding ques-tions of agency in the historically constructed lived practices of young people). {\&}quot;:
As discussed by White {\&}amp;amp; Wyn (1989), different theoretical approaches emphasize different aspects of agency, resulting in particular constraints. They suggest that the deterministic view of agency offers fixed stages and characteristic development in a universalised way, suggesting a denial of agency (White {\&}amp;amp; Wyn 1998, p319). The discussion also highlights the contextual perspective's attempt to discuss agency in terms of historical constructs of lived practice, resulting in a contextualised idea of agency only surfacing in certain situations (White {\&}amp;amp; Wyn 1998, p323). Finally, their discussion of voluntaristic perspective suggests little importance is given to the impact of social structures on adolescent behaviour (White {\&}amp;amp; Wyn 1998, p321). THIS DISCUSSION WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE? we don't want to minimalise the choices of any individual, suggesting that community engaged volunteering is the only means by which to build agency in young people (MY THOUGHTS).
Highlighted on Page 6: Deterministic approaches to the study of young people share one commonassumption: that youth is primarily an age category and that by definition, youngpeople have more in common with each other than they do with adults.
Highlighted on Page 8: Voluntaristic perspectives on young people draw on deterministic elements that arefundamental to the developmental model. These are: the assumption that youngpeople are a homogeneous group defined by age, that youth is a transitional stageof which adulthood is the outcome and that the transition is a matter of individualchoices. Voluntaristic perspectives emphasise a limited notion of agency-individ-ual choice-while being underpinned by a mechanistic and deterministic definitionof the relationship between identity and society. The emphasis on individual choicetends to render structural constraints and processes of social divisions in society aseither quite invisible or as inevitable and irrelevant.
Highlighted on Page 10: In both of the broad areas that we have canvassed here, young people’s agencyis conceived in the very limited sense of making choices against a backdrop inwhich the social forces which generate inequalities are muted.
Highlighted on Page 10: Contextual perspectives on youth and youth agency start from different assump-tions than those guiding the previous two approaches. The most important ofthese is a level of scepticism about the relevance of age as a social category.Although youth remains an important concept, it is important because of theextent to which age relations are related to wider relations of social division andof social control, not because age is of itself a significant or ’essential’ category.Following from this, young people are seen as a highly differentiated group, andthe onus is on the researcher to demonstrate the specific ways in which relationsof age affect and are affected by young people (see for example, McRobbie 1991;Jones and Wallace 1992).},

abstract = {This working paper is a summary of the author's dissertation, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for her doctoral degree under the supervision of Dr. Judith Torney-Purta (successfully defended February 4, 2009). In her study she explored potential explanations for disparities in adolescent civic engagement through a comprehensive examination of context effects, including a focus on the mechanisms by which schools and neighborhoods collectively facilitate civic engagement. Learning the specific characteristics, practices, and processes of schools that help or hinder diverse groups of adolescents can suggest best practices for enhancing civic engagement for young people of a particular demographic background or in a particular neighborhood environment. Four consistent patterns emerged from the analyses (across the four civic outcomes). First, there is a civic engagement gap among adolescents in the United States associated with students' demographic characteristics. Second, civic learning opportunities in many contexts are related to the civic engagement of young people. Third, contextual effects for characteristics of the school such as school socioeconomic status (SES) and school climate for open discourse are found over and above individual effects. Fourth, aspects of the neighborhood context influence adolescents' civic outcomes through interactions with the school environment, students' civic experiences, and students' demographic characteristics. The current study provides further support for the existence of distinguishable types of civic-related school experiences and the importance of examining multiple contexts of influence on development. A list of items and scales used in the analyses is appended. (Contains 3 figures and 5 footnotes.)},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence about optimal youth development highlights the importance of both reducing negative behavior and promoting positive behavior. In our study we tested a contextual model derived from positive youth-development theory by examining the association of family, school, and community risk and promotive factors, with several outcome indices of both positive and negative adolescent development. METHODS: A sample of 42305 adolescents aged 11 to 17 (51{\%} girls) was drawn from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health. Survey item composites were formed representing promotive and risk factors in the family (eg, closeness, aggression) and school and community (eg, community connectedness, school violence). Outcome composites reflected positive (social competence, health-promoting behavior, self-esteem) and negative (externalizing, internalizing, academic problems) developmental outcomes. Ordinary least squares regression was used to test the overall model. RESULTS: Between 0.10 and 0.50 of the variance in each outcome was explained by the contextual model. Multiple positive family characteristics were related to adolescent social competence and self-esteem, as well as lowered levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior and academic problems. Family communication, rules about television, and parents' own healthy behavior were related to adolescent health-promoting behavior. School and community safety were associated with increased social competence and decreased externalizing behavior. School violence was related to adolescent internalizing and externalizing behavior, as well as academic problems and lower self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the proposition that healthy adolescent development has roots in multiple contexts. Youth who were involved in contexts that provided positive resources from important others (ie, parents, schools, and communities) not only were less likely to exhibit negative outcomes, but also were more likely to show evidence of positive development. These findings provide important implications for intervention and prevention efforts and, more generally, for the promotion of positive, competent, and healthy youth development.},

When young people take their moral interests into the realm of political action, moral identity is annealed and a lasting new level of maturity is reached. Political participation is not the only path to a mature identity, but it is effective and supported by empirical findings and theory. This thesis contrasts with positions that follow from more familiar theories of moral development which emphasise reasoning over identity, pit the individual against institutional moral traditions and view moral identity as a private possession rather than a shared and public relationship. Attentiveness to political engagement puts focus on developmental processes of dealing with competing interests and on institutions that serve as repositories of moral traditions, thus linking youth to moral communities. As a result, individuals are able to form identities in relationship to established traditi...},

abstract = {This paper provides a summary of our past and recent work on the questions of whether and how involvement in community service promotes civic and political development in youth. We focus not on the psychological attributes adolescents bring to service, but on the conditions which make the service experience an opportunity for discovering one's relationship to ongoing value traditions toward society, its problems, and well-being. Our most recent work was centered on four specific issues. Using a quasi-experimental longitudinal design, we found that (1) school-based required service does not dampen enthusiasm in students who already favor service, whereas it generates interest in civic life in students with no prior service experience. Using a path model covering a 2-year period, we found also that (2) participation in challenging service led to a process in which contributions to a sponsoring organization eventuated in changes in the self, increased helpfulness, and ultimately to civic engagement. (3) We found further that adolescents with a clear sense of their identity chose to do challenging service which, in turn, sustained their clarity of self over a 2-year period. (4) Using a nationally representative sample of youth, we found that young adults of age 26 were more likely to have voted and to have done volunteer service when they did do service when they were in high school 8 years previously. It made no difference whether their service during high school was required or voluntary, thus, complementing the results of the first study. Our conclusion is that policy makers should not shy away from having youth participate in civic and political processes. The experience helps to frame civic identities which have lasting positive consequences. (DIPF/Orig.) Dieser Beitrag bietet einen {\"{U}}berblick {\"{u}}ber unsere bisherige Forschung zur Frage, ob und wie gemeinn{\"{u}}tzige T{\"{a}}tigkeit b{\"{u}}rgerschaftliches und politisches Engagement bei Jugendlichen f{\"{o}}rdert. Dabei werden weniger die psychischen Dispositionen betrachtet, die Jugendliche dazu motivieren, gemeinn{\"{u}}tzige T{\"{a}}tigkeit aufnehmen. Vielmehr stehen die Bedingungen im Vordergrund, unter denen gemeinn{\"{u}}tzige T{\"{a}}tigkeit dazu beitragen kann, dass Jugendliche ihre Eingebundenheit in gesellschaftliche Prozesse entdecken. Unsere j{\"{u}}ngere Forschung hat dabei vier Aspekte in den Mittelpunkt ger{\"{u}}ckt: (1.) Verpflichtende gemeinn{\"{u}}tzige T{\"{a}}tigkeit im Rahmen der High School-Zeit mindert nicht die Bereitschaft und Begeisterung Jugendlicher, sich freiwillig zu engagieren. Sie erzeugt vielmehr politisches Interesse bei Jugendlichen, die vor dem verpflichtenden Service nicht gemeinn{\"{u}}tzig t{\"{a}}tig waren. In einer L{\"{a}}ngsschnittstudie fanden wir mittels Strukturgleichungsmodellen (2.), dass gemeinn{\"{u}}tzige T{\"{a}}tigkeit in direkter Interaktion mit bed{\"{u}}rftigen Menschen in karitativen Organisationen zu einem ver{\"{a}}nderten Selbstbild, erh{\"{o}}hter Hilfsbereitschaft und zu politischer Sensibilisierung f{\"{u}}hrt. Wir fanden (3.), dass Jugendliche mit einem konturierten Selbstbild eher herausfordernde gemeinn{\"{u}}tzige T{\"{a}}tigkeiten w{\"{a}}hlten, was ihrer Identit{\"{a}}tsentwicklung nochmals f{\"{o}}rderlich war. (4.) An einem f{\"{u}}r die USA repr{\"{a}}sentativen Jugend-Survey konnten wir zeigen, dass junge Erwachsene im Alter von 26 Jahren eher w{\"{a}}hlen gehen, wenn sie als Jugendliche gemeinn{\"{u}}tzig aktiv waren.

Unsere Schlussfolgerung ist, dass politische Entscheidungstr{\"{a}}ger gemeinn{\"{u}}tzige T{\"{a}}tigkeit Jugendlicher f{\"{o}}rdern sollten, weil Heranwachsenden die dabei gemachten Erfahrungen helfen, eine b{\"{u}}rgerschaftliche Identit{\"{a}}t mit lang anhaltenden, positiven Wirkungen f{\"{u}}r die Demokratie zu entwickeln.

Using a case study from a predominantly Black, urban high school in Washington, D.C., Youniss and Yates build on the insights of Erik Erikson on the social and historical nature of identity development. They show that service at a soup kitchen as part of a course on social justice gives youth the opportunity to reflect on their status in society, on how society is organized, on how government should use its power, and on moral principles related to homelessness and poverty. Developing a sense of social responsibility and a civic commitment, youth come to see themselves as active agents in society. The most authoritative work to date on the subject, this book challenges negative stereotypes of contemporary adolescents and illustrates how youth, when given the opportunity, can use their talents for social good.

Meaningful activity - service initiatives should address real needs in the community, align with personal values, leaving youth with memories of quality projects (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9)
Emphasis on Helping Others - programs need to avoid a focus on the self, framing service in terms of their benefit to the volunteers. By focusing on others, youth are able to understand their role in society (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Integrated Part of Articulated Ideology - the role and purpose of service need to be articulated in a way that links to overarching principles and belief systems through discussion in which all individuals have a voice (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Group rather than Individual Action - group dynamics, discussions and identity can encourage service commitment and identity (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Reflective Opportunity with Peers - the complementary aspect of reflection and learning opportunities allows individuals to reflect on service in light of their lives, social realities and social justice (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Service Organisers as Models {\&}amp; Integrators - Facilitators of such programs are important role models for youth (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Site Supervisors as Models - As with facilitators, those working at volunteering sites offer another, often unappreciated, role model (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Acknowledging Participants Diversity - by acknowledging and discussing the differences of service staff, recipients and other protagonists, potentially awkward situations can become elements of unity and a means to overcome prejudices (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9). 
Sense of Being Part of History - the belief that their actions contribute to a sense of history fosters identity development and connection to society (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Responsibility - giving participants responsibilities in service projects detracts from a focus on social freedoms, creates meaning and gives greater personal importance for the service in which they embark (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, Ch9).
Chapter 1
Service is a means to build on pre-existing strengths and should not be viewed as a means to overcome perceived deficits (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p14).
By realigning the perception of service from maintaining the status quo to that of history making, attitudes of youth can be energised towards justice and social change. (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p16-17)
Volunteering also provides avenues for youth to access adult society and consequently establish themselves socially (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p18).
Chapter 2
When individuals morality is indistinguishable from their identities, individuals will often undertake significant sacrifices for the service of others as a matter of course (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p20).
Community service provides opportunity for both personal identity and social identity development (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p20).
Providing service opportunities for youth, they use existing and developing skills on real-world social problems, giving them agency and responsibility for social betterment (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p36). Participating as a group, particularly at the encouragement of adults, provides youth the opportunity to understand society in light of moral ideologies (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p36). Finally, public and private reflection allows integration of these values in the construction of identity (Youniss {\&}amp; Yates 1997, p36).

From Duplicate 2 (Community Service and Social Responsibility in Youth - Youniss, James)

P625 - Flanagan et al. (1997) proposed that organized groups that provide youth with experience in service to the community connect them {\&}quot;to the broader polity and, in that process [help them] develop an understanding of themselves as civic actors{\&}quot; (p. 3). We have argued similarly on the basis of our studies of high school students who proceeded through a year of community service at a soup kitchen for the homeless (Yates {\&}amp; Youniss, 1996; Youniss {\&}amp; Yates, 1997). As the year progressed, students started to view the people they served no longer stereotypically as {\&}quot;the homeless{\&}quot; but as individuals with various problems and complicated life histories. Students also started to assess themselves consciously, focusing not only on their fortunate positions relative to homeless persons but equally often as potential actors in the reforms needed to redress poverty and homelessness. The students also began to raise questions about the political system that allowed homelessness to expand and the choices that pertained to providing accessible housing, job training, and welfare reform. Finally, youth also addressed the moral and ethical aspects of homelessness, including who had responsibility to attend to this social problem and what justice would demand regarding income inequality in America.},

abstract = {Mature moral and civic life is distinguished by respect for common humanity which develops through participation in community service. This proposition is illustrated by studies of adults who rescued Jews during World War II and contemporary adults who lead lives of moral commitment. These individuals do not view themselves as heroic but believe that their moral sense and actions simply express their identity. A putative developmental process is described by studies that longitudinally track youth activism to adult moral-civic behavior 10 to 30 years later and that detail changes in adolescents' thinking during a course on Christian social justice that required community service. Everyday morality seems to be rooted in an essential identity rather than being mediated by calculated reason. It follows that educators who seek to justify service learning can emphasize the identity process while pointing to the life-long linkage between youth participation and adult moral-civic activism.},

Highlighted on Page 1-2: During the 1990s, several school districts debated the merits of putting community service into the curriculum. Various rationales were proposed,with most focused on the theme of promoting good citizenship. In reviewing some of this discussion, we found considerable variation on several major issues. For example, the definition of {\&}quot;good citizenship{\&}quot; ranged from simplistic patriotism to a Dewey-like assembly of critical democratic thinkers (Kahne and Westheimer, 1996). Furthermore, arguments for service surpris-ingly failed to cite the extensive empirical literature on positive long-termeffects of youth activism (e.g., Youniss, et al., 1997). In addition, thesearguments typically took no account of developmental factors that mightmake service especially opportune for adolescents and youth who are inthe process of identity formation (Yates and Youniss, 1996; Youniss andYates, 1997).

Highlighted on Page 2: Results indicated that this program made an impact on the students. Among other things, over one-half of the 160 students made more than the four required visits to the kitchen, signifying that they found their service experience engaging. Furthermore, quarterly essays and group discussions indicated that students changed their viewpoints over the year. For example,many students abandoned an initially negative view of homeless people and a disinterest in homelessness by gaining appreciation of the humanity of homeless people and by showing concern for homelessness in relation to poverty, job training, low-cost housing, prison reform, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, care for the mentally ill, quality urban education, and welfare policy. Several students also altered perceptions of themselves from politically impotent teenagers to involved citizens who now and the in the future could use their talent and power to correct social problems. They projected articulated pictures of themselves as adult citizens who could affect housing policies, education for minorities, and government programs within a clear framework of social justice (Youniss and Yates, 1997).
Highlighted on Page 3: In probing the meaning of students' interest in the religious and political traditions they were thinking of joining, we were led to Erikson's view on youth's need for transcendent meaning as they establish their identity within a collective framework (e.g., Erikson, 1968). And in evaluating students' shift from disinterest to concern for social issues, and from feelings of distance to compassionate understanding of the homeless, we explored the literature which defines morality in terms of non heroic, every-day respect for other persons as a matter of personal identity (Blasi, 1984;Davidson and Youniss, 1991).
Highlighted on Page 2-3: In exploring the meaning of students' engagement, we inspected studies of student activism, such as participation in civil rights and other causes in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., Fendrich, 1993; McAdam, 1988). In assessing students' sense of social responsibility, we drew from research on adolescent and adult moral exemplars whose moral commitment was said to be essential to the self-concept (e.g., Colby and Damon, 1992; Hart and Fegley,1995)
Highlighted on Page 3: Barber and Eccles (1997) reported that 10th graders who participated in prosocial activities, such as attending church or doing volunteer work, were,in grade 12, less prone to delinquent activities such as drug or alcohol use and to skipping school than were non participants. J
Highlighted on Page 3: Johnson et al. (1998) reported that adolescents who had participated in volunteer service during high school were significantly more likely to do volunteer service in the 4 years after high school than peers who had not volunteered during high school.
Highlighted on Page 4: ccles {\&}amp; Barber (1998). High-school students in Michigan, categorized by extracurricular activities. Result: Students involved in prosocial activities in Grade 10, vs. those who were not, differed in subsequent academic grades and risk-taking.Johnson et al. (1998). High-school student in Minnesota who did service vs. those who did not. Result: Students who did service during high school were likely to do service during the 4 years after high school. Beane et al. (1981). 82 adults who had participated in town planning project in senior year. Result: 30 years later, participants, vs. non participants, belonged to more local voluntary associations. Ladewig {\&}amp; Thomas (1987). National sample of adults, differentiated by youth membership in 4-H and other such organizations. Result: 25 years later, participants were twice as likely to belong and three times as likely to lead voluntary associations than were non participants. Hanks {\&}amp; Eckland (1978). National sample (N = 1827) of adults who participated in high-school government or academic clubs. Result: 15 years later participants were more likely than non participants to belong to voluntary associations, vote, and trust the political process.Otto (1976). 376 adults who had participated, or not, in high-school extracurricular activities.Result: 15 years later, participants were more likely to belong to voluntary associations and to have voted. Verba et al. (1995). 2517 adults were assessed on current political behavior. Result: In regression analysis, the best predictor of current voting or association membership was prior participation in high-school government.De Martini (1983). Review of 7 studies comparing participants in civil rights (2 studies),free-speech (3 studies), or antiwar (2 studies) movements with non participants. Result:3 to 11 years later, activists were politically more active and tended to shift to the political center. McAdam (1988). Mostly white college students who had participated in the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer project, compared with approved candidates who did not show. Result:25 years later, participants were still distinguishable in political activism, which was now directed to various causes beyond civil rights. Fendrich (1993). Florida A{\&}amp;M and Florida State students who had or had not participated in civil rights demonstrations. Result: 10-25 years later, participants were {\&}quot;ideal citizens{\&}quot;in terms of marriage, education, employment, voting, and community involvement.
Highlighted on Page 5: It is important to recognize that activism is typically sponsored by agencies or institutions which stand for particular religious, political, or other kinds of ideological positions. When youth participate in these activities, they are exposed to and, thus, are potentially socialized into these ideological traditions. This gives them opportunities to assess themselves as participants in historical traditions, which Erikson (1968) argued, is essential for identity development.
Highlighted on Page 7: As researchers, we were led to the importance of the self-other relationship because the most frequent kind of reflection by students in our study was the discovery that the homeless were actually real people with human biographies and characteristics similar to their own.
Highlighted on Page 8: The humanizing process was abetted when homeless people revealed aspects of their own life stories
Highlighted on Page 8: All of these factors helped the students come to the realization that the lives of homeless people were similar to their own and were much like the lives of people students knew well. In articulating that the homeless were normal human beings, the students took a basic step toward forming a moral relationship of respect with them. This point was attested to by the compassion that came into essays and discussions as the year progressed.
Highlighted on Page 9: Gross notes that these Christian groups could easily have avoided aiding Jews because of religious differences. But both took action because the people believed it was their communal duty. Each community was organized in democratic form so that, in principle, every citizen should have been accorded equal rights and fair treatment. According to the participants,not to extend this right to Jews would have undermined the basis of community
Highlighted on Page 9: The implications are that moral action in the form of sheltering was applied well beyond personal relationships. Gross describes the several functions that were required to protect Jews for extended periods of time:feeding and clothing, procuring rationing coupons, finding housing, taking care of secure communication, providing transportation, and managing intelligence
Highlighted on Page 10: In her words, the convent's task of sheltering these hunted people {\&}quot;. . . flowed from themost important Christian commandment, from the commandment of love{\&}quot;(p. 331).
Highlighted on Page 10: Related to this projection of agency is the development of a sense of responsibility. It is one thing to imagine oneself as having agency, but quite another to believe that one's power should be used for the good of society.Students did this, perhaps most powerfully, when they pictured themselves as the next generation in a historical process that began with their grandparents' and parents' participation in the civil rights struggle. In this regard,they viewed their future role as continuing to move toward the goal of a single society that operated on principles of justice.
Highlighted on Page 11: the integrity of the community depended on extending the basis of the community to all people for the good of all, those oppressed and those not oppressed.
Highlighted on Page 11: We now turn to other studies to illustrate the usefulness of viewing morality as part of identity rather than as a specialized psychological function. In three studies of moral exemplars (Colby and Damon, 1992; Gross,1997; Hart and Fegley, 1995), effort was made to determine whether individuals who were exceptional in their practice of moral behavior also reasoned at higher levels. All three studies reported that these exceptional individuals were not high-level reasoners. Exemplars were more apt to justify their moral actions in terms of preserving social norms than in expressing abstract universal principles focused on individual rights. Comparing rescuers with non rescuers, Gross (1997) used hyperbole to state that the morally more articulate seem politically incompetent, whereas the politically competent are less morally articulate. Successful collective action must utilize the parochial, social, religious, and civic norms inherent in a small, tightly knit,and interdependent moral community. The value of these norms dissipates as individuals become morally developed and autonomous. Deprived of the necessary moral community, enlightened moral reasoners often come up short on political action (p. 150).
Highlighted on Page 11: Monroe and Epperson propose that ethical action proceeds primarily from one's perception of self in relation to others because {\&}quot;this perception effectively delineates and sets the domain of choice options perceived as available to an actor, both in an empirical and a moral sense{\&}quot; (p. 219).
Highlighted on Page 12: . To understand the breadth of a person's moral orientation, then, one needs to know how that individual conceives of the self in relationship to personal others and to society.
Highlighted on Page 12: everyday morality evolves from habitual action into a defined identity. Once in place, a call to action is turned on when someone in need happens in your path. The relevance of our work is in showing how the formation of habit emerges through service during the formative period of youth. Because service allows youth to practice moral behavior, they have the opportunity to experience them-selves as effective moral actors within a particular religious-political tradition. Seeing that they can actually help homeless hungry people, and then possibly projecting themselves as having skills and responsibility for ad-dressing social ills, youth have taken a large step toward incorporating morality into their identities. It is from such moral identities that spontaneous morality flows in adults.
Highlighted on Page 12: Blasi (1984) raised the rhetorical question of whether morality should be attributed to reasoning or to the person who reasons and acts
Highlighted on Page 12: More-or-less moral people may use reasoning to appraise situations, but ultimately moral choice and action come from the individual's sense of self in relationship to others. Davidson and Youniss (1991), extending Blasi's position, suggest that moral actions lead to a moral identity which, in turn, leads to further moral actions and solidification of moral identity. Eventually, then, it be-comes futile to ask whether morality or identity comes first?
Highlighted on Page 12: In their study of adolescent moral exemplars, Hart and Fegley (1995;Hart et al., 1995) reported that exemplars, compared with matched peers,have more closely integrated their ideal and real selves in defining who they morally are.
Highlighted on Page 13: Colby and Damon (1995) provide a concise discussion of what some may see as a problem with this position. A spate of recent literature has divided the world into self-interest and actions that serve others, but with a presumed cost to the self. What Colby and Damon argue, however, is that a self who is defined in moral terms is not sacrificing but enhancing oneself when helping others. This is the gist of Hart and Fegley's finding on real- and ideal-self integration: the doing of altruistic acts is actually away of expressing who the moral self is.
Highlighted on Page 13: Teske (1997), who studied 60 contemporary exemplar-activists, also takes the position that morality is not a separate function that comes into play only at critical moments when specialized skills are recruited. He proposes that morality is {\&}quot;about what kind of person one is, about who one is as an individual, and about how one chooses to live one's life{\&}quot;(p. 96). Moral concerns, then, are {\&}quot;rooted in a sense of who [people] are and who they want to be{\&}quot; (p. 96).
Highlighted on Page 13: I acted as I did because that is who I am.
Highlighted on Page 13: From a developmental perspective, one would propose that moral actions lead to moral identity, which in turn promotes further moral actions.
Highlighted on Page 13: rikson (1968) suggests that when youth seek identity, they quest for present meaning which is transcendent, which is grounded in a respectable past, and which offers promise for the future.In many of the cases we have reviewed, adults found transcendence via identification with a religious or political ethos whose empirical history affords an ideological outlook on past achievement. Insofar as previous generations of people have acted within these frameworks, the self can join a collective entity which provides a clear picture of a desired future.
Highlighted on Page 14: In the kind of moral identity that was being promoted, the self and moral goals are closely allied. Teske has proposed that moral-political action enables people {\&}quot;to fulfill quite rational desires, among them becoming the kind of person they want to be, instantiating qualities and virtues that they admire, playing a role (however small) in history, ensuring that their lives as a whole leave behind a certain kind of story, and upholding their most deeply held value commitments through their actions and their lives{\&}quot; (p. 143). Small stories that comprise a morality of everyday life were given to the students in their meeting the homeless and serving them,allowing the discovery of relationships of respect to others.
Highlighted on Page 14: Because service opportunities are typically provided by organizations that represent the sources of meaning described above, grounds are being established for the cultivation of morally productive identities. But some youth have little exposure to these identity-making experiences, and still others have mainly negative ideological options offered to them. Because youth seek transcendent meaning, adults need to take their responsibility seriously to present opportunities that will produce more Tonys (Monroe and Epperson, 1994) and to counteract groups that instill racial and religious intolerance.
Highlighted on Page 15: It is important, then, that adults see the potential of well-designed service programs and recognize that youth are attracted to ideological positions, without regard for their source. Thus, the keen challenge to educators is to provide options on which constructive identities can be built and from which collective every-day morality can develop.},

Highlighted on Page 1: Much has been learned about the formative experiences that lead to civic participation and to other civic attitudes and competencies (Sherrod, 2007; Watts {\&}amp; Flanagan, 2007; Youniss, McLellan, {\&}amp; Yates, 1997; Zaff, Hart et al., 2010). Best practices for promoting participation, attitudes, and competencies have been drawn from cross-sectional, longitudinal, and randomized studies of individual and contextual factors (Zaff {\&}amp; Michelsen, 2001).
Highlighted on Page 2: a higher-order, integrated civic engagement construct, Active and Engaged Citizenship (AEC;Zaff, Boyd, Li, Lerner, {\&}amp; Lerner, 2010).
Highlighted on Page 2: We define civic engagement as more than actions enhancing the greater good, whether through community action,advocacy, or political participation: Our conceptualization includes the motivation to engage in such civic behaviors. This conception of civic engagement is consistent with the school engagement literature (Fredericks, Blumenfeld, {\&}amp; Paris, 2004),which involves the integration of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral facets of this construct (Li, in press). Thus, we conceive of civic engagement as an integration of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive factors within the individual. Youniss (2006), in the area of youth civic engagement, and developmental action theorists (e.g.,Freund {\&}amp; Baltes, 2002), studying individual “context relations more generally, consider the dynamic interplay between cognitive processes and behaviors, as central for motivating behaviors. 
Highlighted on Page 2: Thus, one might hypothesize that civic engagement could be expressed as a connection to one's community, a commitment to improving that community, and the act of helping one's community. Actions that enhance the community in this way will likely feed back to the individual, thus supporting his/her positive development (Lerner, 2004; Lerner, Alberts, {\&}amp; Bobek,2007).
Highlighted on Page 2: In a recent cross-sectional study found that civic participation, knowledge, skills, efficacy, and interest plateau at approximately age 16 (Hart {\&}amp; Atkins, 2011).
Highlighted on Page 2: research has identified how individuals transitioning to adulthood have become, across birth cohorts over the past three decades,increasingly less likely to engage in a variety of civic behaviors (Flanagan, Levine {\&}amp; Settersten, 2009; Syvertsen, Wray-Lake,Flanagan, Osgood, {\&}amp; Briddell, 2011).

Highlighted on Page 3: As argued by Benson, Scales, Hamilton, and Semsa (2006), OST activities represent key ecological sources of influences promoting PYD (e.g., mentors, opportunities for youth-adult collaboration, and contexts for learning important life skills;Eccles {\&}amp; Gootman,2002).
Highlighted on Page 3: out-of-school time (OST) activities
Highlighted on Page 3: Youth development programs are activities that provide a nurturing, safe, structured space for youth to explore and experience their worlds and to learn skills that are related to academic success, social competence, and civic engagement (e.g.,see Eccles {\&}amp; Gootman, 2002). 
Highlighted on Page 3: By engaging in such actions, youth can gain a concrete understanding of, and connection to, the social and economic issues that affect their and other communities, developing personal connections to the issues (Eyler {\&}amp; Giles, 1999; Youniss {\&}amp; Yates, 1997).
Highlighted on Page 3: In addition to explicitly promoting civic activities, non-civic, extracurricular activities, such as sports or the arts, youth development programs can serve as microcosms of public life, thus providing opportunities for civic skill building and awareness raising that are in turn related to later civic engagement (Thomas {\&}amp; McFarland, 2010). 
Highlighted on Page 3: Gibson (2008)found that intense religious involvement and more theologically conservative beliefs were related to higher rates of youth volunteering in their communities.
Highlighted on Page 7: In 8th Grade, the youth in our study showed a relatively high sense of duty (mean - 17.00), followed by neighborhood social connection (14.68) and sense of efficacy (13.56). The youth participated at a relatively low level of civic activities (8.36).
Highlighted on Page 7: While all of the AEC components showed a gradual upward trajectory from 8th to 11th Grade, the rate of change varied from component to component, and not all slopes were significant 
Highlighted on Page 7: Notably, although civic efficacy measured lower than civic duty and neighborhood connectedness in 8th Grade, its comparatively steep slope showed that youth civic efficacy surpassed neighborhood connectedness by 11th Grade. This finding suggests that the gap between youth sense of civic duty and youth civic efficacy narrows throughout adolescence. By the 11th Grade, youth appear to believe both that they have a duty to effect change in their communities and that they are capable of effecting change. However, the slope for civic participation was not very steep (coefficient{\^{A}}¼.22,p{\&}lt;.05) and stayed well below the levels for the other AEC components. Thus, there might be a gap between connection to one's neighborhood,sense of duty to effect change in that neighborhood, and sense of efficacy to effect that change, on the one hand, and actual participation, on the other hand.
Highlighted on Page 8: Do youth development programs affect the development of each component of civic engagement in the same way?Our analysis suggested that average program participation level interacted with the developmental trajectory of each of the AEC components, except for civic efficacy
Highlighted on Page 8: Program participation also had a significant positive effect on the intercepts for Participation, Efficacy, Neighborhood Connection, and the AEC total, suggesting that youth who are highly involved in one or more programmatic activities are already likely by 8thGrade to feel more efficacious about performing various civic tasks, more supported and respected by the communities inwhich they live, and more likely to participate in civic activities
Highlighted on Page 8: These findings suggest that youth who attended religious services more frequently felt well-respected and supported by the adults in their communities, felt a sense of duty to help improve one's community, had higher levels of self-efficacy with regard to civic activities, and were more likely to participate in civic actions
Highlighted on Page 10: Because opportunities to participate in civic actions increase during the high school years (Corporation for National and Community Service, 2006), we would expect civic participation to increase; but extant data show consistently low rates of civic participation, suggesting that there is a gap between the perceived capacity and desire to effect change in communities, and the actual actions that young people can take to effect those changes.
Highlighted on Page 10: youth experienced a narrowing gap between civic duty and civic efficacy, meaning that these aspects of civic engagement might become more congruent by Grade 11 (i.e., youth might feel that they should and want to participate in the community and help others and feel they are prepared to do so). 
Highlighted on Page 10: Civic participation does not follow the same trajectory. Perhaps youth programs are missing important opportunities to capture young people at the time when they feel capable and willing to participate by not offering developmentally appropriate, relevant, and interesting opportunities to them. By capturing youth motivation and interest, and providing adolescents with civic opportunities through youth development (and other) program activities, practitioners might improve the likelihood of program activities engaging youth more explicitly at the behavioral level, which might then result in the enhancement of civic engagement in adulthood. Indeed, recent research suggests that engaging contexts can deepen youth motivation to participate in civic (and non-civic) actions (Dawes {\&}amp; Larson, 2011). On the other hand, this apparent, relatively low rate of participation might in fact provide important and substantive support to social and political causes.
Highlighted on Page 10: Future research could thus examine the possibility that there exist thresholds of participation for impacting communities.
Highlighted on Page 10: Research that has shown a connection between intensity and duration of participation and civic engagement (e.g.,Bobek et al.,2009; Smith, 1999; Zaff et al., 2003) and with research that has taken a more nuanced examination of the formative socio-emotional experiences in youth development programs and of the links between these experiences and futurecivic behaviors(Thomas {\&}amp; McFarland, 2010).
Highlighted on Page 10: including the AEC measure as a time-varying construct might more accurately depict the relationship between program participation and civic engagement. This point may be particularly important, since those youth who start at higher levels at the intercept (8th Grade) had low rates or even slightly negativerates of growth through 11th Grade, while those youth who have lower rates of civic engagement at 8th Grade had steeper rates of growth. This difference could be the result of the higher group have little room for growth after 8th Grade, but it could also signal a reduction in the effect of program participation over time. By including program participation and religious attendance as time-varying covariates, we would have a better idea about the effect of persistent participation and attendance on civic engagement. Exploring these questions could help youth development program leaders to design developmentally appropriate programs.
Highlighted on Page 10: Our measure of participation did not include any assessment of quality. Since program quality may affect the impact of any given program on civic (or other positive or negative) outcomes (Vandell, Reisner, {\&}amp; Pierce, 2007), we might have under-estimated the effect of youth development program participation by conflating participation in low-quality programs with participation in high-quality programs. 
Highlighted on Page 11: Consistent with previous reports that young people who are more active in their religious communities are more civically engaged (Gibson, 2008), we found that religious participation in 8th grade was related to both civic engagement levels in 8th grade and to your trajectories throughout the period of adolescence we studied. 
Highlighted on Page 12: Previous researchers have posited that the moral lessons learned in spiritual contexts, as well as the service projects often conducted by faith-based organizations, could explain this connection (e.g.,Gibson, 2008; Hunsberger {\&}amp; Platanow,1986).
Highlighted on Page 12: Future studies should address this issue by including more comprehensive and relevant measures of religious participation, and by examining factors within the religious experiences,such as moral development, that could explain the connection.
Highlighted on Page 12: over-sampling marginalized youth in future studies may illuminate both differences and similarities in the ways in which these youth develop civically, as well as the effects of developmental context on developmental trajectories. Exploring the civic development of marginalized youths would also help practitioners better understand how to engage youths who are otherwise civically excluded.
Highlighted on Page 12: Better understanding of how to measure program quality and of how programs can incorporate civic activities could enhance our understanding of the relationship between program participation and civic development trajectories. Similarly,researchers should focus in the future on developing more comprehensive measures of religious participation or of faith-based program participation in order to understand better the developmental contexts of the youth who participate in these programs.},

abstract = {Researchers have theorized that programs to promote positive citizenship should begin with an opportunity for adolescents to participate in civic activities, such as community service or political volunteering. In this article we extend the theory by arguing that a more systemic approach is needed, in which a civic context is developed to promote citizenship. We hypothesize that living within a consistent civic context leads to civic engagement in late adolescence and into young adulthood. We use a diverse, longitudinal dataset to test this hypothesis. We find that social interactions with peers, parent modeling of civic behaviors, and cultural factors, such as ethnicity-specific practices, cumulatively result in a higher level of civic activities among youth and that a continued context that includes these factors results in a higher level of civic activities into adulthood. The implications of our findings are discussed with regard to program and policy development.},

Highlighted on Page 8: Youth participation can thus be defined as involving youth in responsible, challenging action thatmeets genuine needs, with the opportunity for planningand/or decision-making affecting others.... There is mutuality in teaching and learning(between youth and adults) and where each age group sees itself as a resource for the other andoffers what it uniquely can provide.1

Highlighted on Page 10: Youth governance(or youth decision-mak-ing) is a fundamental and core strategy ofyouth infusion. It refers to those situationswhere youth work—often in partnership withadults—to set the overall policy direction oforganizations, institutions, and coalitions.
Highlighted on Page 12: During adolescence,many young people are driven to exploreissues of social justice. They are creating andexperimenting with their own principles andpolitical ideas, leading many to becomeinvolved in cause-based action. Consequently,in many organizations, the young peoplebecome the keepers of the vision. They are theones who focus on the mission.

Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Youngpeople especially value the lessons adults bringfrom other organizations; they often seek outthe advice, instruction, and direction thatadults can offer. {\&}quot;:
When youth are integral to an organisation, adults naturally become more supportive and encouraging, and are sought by the youth for advice and direction (p7).
Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; Synergy: Youth-Adult Partnerships forEffective Decision-MakingThe mutual contributions of youth and adultscan result in a synergy, a new power and ener-gy that propels decision-making groups togreater innovation and productivity. We dis-covered that in this atmosphere youth andadults become more committed to attendingmeetings and create a climate that is groundedin honest appraisal, reflection, and ongoinglearning. {\&}quot;:
The synergy created reveals a new energy and capacity which drives productivity and innovation, and creates an increased honesty, a learning attitude and greater reflection (p7).
Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; “Having youth involved in decision-making changes theadult staff role from parental authority figure to partner.It improves staff performance. Through that change,youth and adults are able to join around a commongoal. This is much different from the traditional adultrole of telling kids what to do.... Youth embrace thisautonomy and freedom to influence the organization.” {\&}quot;:
When youth work alongside adults, the dynamic of the organisation changes. Adults change from parental authority to colleague, and all are able to work collaboratively towards a common goal, with improved performance from staff and a newly found autonomy and freedom from the youth (p7).
Comment on Page 14, on highlighted text {\&}quot; This synergy stems from the good fitbetween youth and adults who are in differentstages of their lives, and therefore have differ-ent interests, skills, and experiences to bring tothe table. {\&}quot;:
Since decision making thrives in environments of diverse opinions and life situations, youth naturally complement the dynamics of the process (p7).

Adults came to understand the needs andconcerns of youth, and became moreattuned to programming issues, makingthem more likely to reach outside theorganization and share their new knowl-edge and insights. They gained a strongersense of community connectedness. {\&}quot;:
Working with, and relating to, youth allowed adults to feel more confident and effective. The program itself also became more effective as a result of youth involvement, as the adults understanding of the challenges and needs of youth was heightened, resulting in greater organisational reach and community connectedness (p8).

Working with youth served to enhance thecommitment and energy of adults to theorganization. {\&}quot;:
Through the process of integrating youth, adults are able to get personal experience about the capacity of youth, improving their perception of the younger generation. Youth were also able to inspire greater energy and commitment from their adult counterparts (p8).
Comment on Page 15, on highlighted text {\&}quot; 1. The principles and practices of youthinvolvement became embedded within theorganizational culture. 2. Most organizations found that young peo-ple help clarify and bring focus to theorganization’s mission, and some organiza-tions made this a formal role of youth. 3.

Youth involvement brought about greater focus and clarification to the organisations goals and mission. The organisation placed an increased value on the importance of a diversity opinions in the consultation process. Funding bodies also recognised that the organisation placed a high priority on youth development. Organisations were more likely to reach out to the community as a result of youth involvement (p8-9).

Comment on Page 16, on highlighted text {\&}quot; 1. The top decision-making body in theorganization needs to be committed toyouth governance and youth-adult partner-ships, and must change their ways of oper-ating accordingly. The data are clear: If agovernance body is focused on vision andlearning, there is room for young people tomake substantial contributions. If it is moretraditionally focused on rule making andmanagement, then it is less likely thatyoung people will have a significant influ-ence on the board. {\&}quot;:
For youth to become an integral part of an organisations decision-making process, the organisation has to be open and flexible to the process; organisations open to learning and focused and goals, instead of management and rules, provides the ideal environment for youth involvement (p9).

Youth involvement in governance provides impetus and power, particularly when adults recognise the importance of such a process (p9-10).
Comment on Page 17, on highlighted text {\&}quot; 4. Adult views about young people are diffi-cult to change, and this is true even foradults in governance positions. Changeoccurs when the organization offers threetypes of experiences to adults.a) Adults perceived a good reason to workwith youth. The governance work had tobe purposefully oriented towards mean-ingful outcomes. Adult attitudes did notchange when the decision-making wasperceived as symbolic or tokenistic.b) Adult attitude change occurs most readi-ly when young people perform well inthe boardroom, or in other places thatadults regard as adults’ turf. It is impor-tant for adults to witness youth succeed-ing in the nuts and bolts of organiza-tional improvement.c) Adults change their views of young peo-ple when they have the opportunity toobserve youth engaged in communityaction that had real payoffs for commu-nity residents. {\&}quot;:
Changing adult opinions around youth can be changed given: adults have a purposeful reason to include youth; youth are able to demonstrate skills and abilities applicable to the situation; and youth engagement is observed to have genuine impact on the community (p10).
Comment on Page 17, on highlighted text {\&}quot; 5. Organizational change occurs most rapidlywhen adults perceive the young people aseffective decision-makers. For this reason,the young people who were nominated totake on key governance roles were selectedcarefully, just as the adults were. Most ofthe organizations had created a kind ofscaffolding for youth to work their way upthrough the organization, engaging in avariety of leadership-building and decision-making opportunities. {\&}quot;:
Creating an environment susceptible to effective youth engagement requires both youth and adults open to the process (p10).

The organizations inthis study recognize this difference. Whiledecision-makers ranged in age from twelveto twenty-three, the majority fell betweenthe ages of seventeen and twenty-one. Themean age of those whom the organizationschose to be their spokespersons for thisstudy was eighteen years. It seems that theorganization, in their desire to ensure theearly success of youth governance, havedecided to begin with older youth and toeventually integrate younger adolescentsinto governance. {\&}quot;:
Organisations who recognise the different developmental stages of youth were more likely to integrate the youth more effectively (p10).},
